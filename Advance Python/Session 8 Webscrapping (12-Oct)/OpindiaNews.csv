0,13-Oct-23,"Ladakh Congress working president justifies Hamas atrocities on innocent Israelis, tries to falsely project ‘Palestinian Mujahideens’ as victims","Umpteen visuals are available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery that Hamas has inflicted on Israeli civilians.Along the lines of his higher-ups in Delhi, Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress has declared his unwavering support for the Palestinians and their terrorist organisation Hamas, which has been committing horrific atrocities and war crimes against Israel since it launched an unprecedented attack on the nation on October 7. ‘Hamas Mujahideen from Gaza have started to take back their land from America’s pet Israel, killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire. The resolution however backed the Palestinian people’s rights.The Congress party’s official statement emphasised the process of “dialogue and negotiations” to resolve the problem between Israel and Palestine.India's Congress party comes in support of Palestine after a key meeting https://t.co/5XqyfamvVH“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people.

1,13-Oct-23,Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts,"CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

2,12-Oct-23,"New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee","It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

3,11-Oct-23,"IUML, which Rahul Gandhi called secular, extends support to Palestine even after Hamas beheads and rapes Israelis ","Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML).On Tuesday (10th October), the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) announced its support for Palestine while asserting that Israel’s ‘occupation’ of the state of Palestine is the main cause of the surging tensions in West Asia. In its resolution, IUML stated, “It is a hot reality that Israel’s occupation of Palestine is the root cause of the entire West Asian tensions.Moreover, the League claimed that Israel’s ‘encroachment’ of Khuds Mosque is “extremely unjustified”.Interestingly, while it was the Hamas terrorist organisation that launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians this week, the IUML asserted that Israel is “not just against Palestine but against the entire global human community.” The IUML termed the Israel-Hamas conflict as a human rights issue.Furthermore, the IUML urged the United Nations to bring up a peaceful solution to the ‘Palestinian issue’ adding that India has always stood with Palestine.The party offered its “strong support to the Palestinian people and also expressed its protest over the “unfair developments” in Palestine.It is worth noting that the IUML which is an offshoot of the Muslim League that played a significant role in the partition of India is an ally of the Congress party. While the IUML has links with Jammat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), both accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of spreading radicalism in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had called the IUML a ‘secular’ party.During his controversial US visit in June this year, Rahul Gandhi asserted that the Muslim League, a Muslim political party in India which played a vital role in the partition of India on religious lines, was “completely secular”. The interviewer asked him, “You talked about secularism and democracy while opposing the Hindu party BJP, however, the Congress in Kerala has been in alliance with the Muslim party, the Muslim League in Kerala, the state from which you were an MP”. To this, Rahul Gandhi said, “Muslim League is a completely secular party, there is nothing non-secular about the Muslim League. I think the person has not studied the Muslim League”.Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. While the IUML on its website claims that it is “uncompromisingly anchors the nationalist and secular principles”, the party’s activities have been in sharp contrast to this.The IUML backing Palestine is not surprising since a Muslim party’s leaders feel religiously obligated to stand with the Ummah. On 9th October, the Congress party passed a resolution backing the Palestinian people while raising concerns over the situation.“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop,” the Congress party said.Interestingly, the Congress party’s resolution did not even mention the words Hamas or Israel. Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in a conversation with IndiaToday said that “Hamas cannot be called a terrorist organisation”. He asserted that while the US has labelled Hamas as a terrorist organisation, the government of India has not made any such classification. Tharoor’s assertion comes even when Prime Minister Modi has explicitly termed the attacks on Israel as “terrorist attacks”.Tharoor says- ""Can't label Hamas as Terrorist Organisation"" pic.twitter.com/BDOgZNfXatPerhaps out of political imperative to avoid upsetting the ‘vote bank,’ the Congress party cannot comprehend that Hamas holding innocent Israeli people hostage, killing children and families, and raping numerous civilians is terrorism.The recent Israel-Hamas war began on Saturday (7th October) when the State of Israel was attacked by the Palestine-based Islamic terror group Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya commonly known as Hamas, resulting in the deaths of over 1000 Israelis. Nearly 2400 people have been wounded, with dozens are still being held captive by the Hamas terrorists.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

However, their apparent purpose was to celebrate and glorify the tragic murder of over 200 innocent Israelies.

Both community members marched shoulder to shoulder as they unequivocally condemned terrorism. According to BNN Network, the protest was also organised to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict.Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow on 9th October released a statement saying that the rally organised in support of the terrorist organisation Hamas was an unsanctioned one and without a permit.Chow “unequivocally” denounced the rally and said that the Chief of Police has assured her that they will investigate the matter and address any suspected incidents of hate.Meanwhile, Canada’s Minister of Finance, Chrystia Freeland expressed support for the pro-Israel demonstrations. “We are in solidarity with you,” she reportedly said.The joint protests by Indians and Jews in Canada are significant for more reasons than one. Canada was recently in the headlines after the House of Commons gave a standing ovation to a former Nazi war criminal Yaroslav Hunka, who was posted in the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”.The incident opened the pandora’s box what with Canada’s history of sheltering Ukrainian nationalists who worked for Hitler’s Nazi army in the second world war. Notably, Chrystia Freeland’s grandfather, too, worked for a Nazi newspaper which was recruited for the Galicia Division of the Waffen-SS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

5,13-Oct-23,Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

6,10-Oct-23,"There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

7,06-Oct-23,The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation,"Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

8,04-Oct-23,"From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game","No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

9,02-Oct-23,"Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar","While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

10,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

11,07-Oct-23,Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

12,25-Sep-23,‘Kapil Dev kidnapped or Harsh Bhogle-type promotional stunt?’ See how Netizens react to a viral video showing goons taking him away,"As soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir's timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha BhogleOn Monday, September 25, a 0.07-second video clip took the internet by storm. The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

13,24-Sep-23,Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’,"In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis.

14,11-Oct-23,"The New York Times publishes a report calling Hamas ‘terrorists’, changes to ‘gunmen’ after some time","There is no mention in the NYT report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel's air defence system Iron Dome.On Tuesday (10th October) The New York Times published a news regarding the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

16,10-Oct-23,"Can Israel be a victim when all countries are supporting it: YouTuber Ravish Kumar downplays Hamas terror attack, floats conspiracy theory","Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these Western nations doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”Two days after Hamas launched a terror attack on the State of Israel and killed 800 civilians in the process, Indian YouTuber Ravish Kumar on Monday (9th October) attempted to paint Hamas as the victim.“Whose terrorism should be condemned? Who is the terrorist in this case? There is another question – Who is the victim?”, he resorted to shielding the Palestine-based Islamist terror organisation Hamas.The former NDTV ‘journalist’ suggested that Israel could not be a victim of terror in the ongoing conflict as several powerful Western nations are supporting the Jewish State. Ravish shamelessly defends Hamas TerroristsAsks who is Real Terrorist- Hamas or Israel?Attacks countries supporting Israel of siding with Terrorists.""हमास और इज़राइल में किसके आतंकवाद की निंदा होनी चाहिए?”""बड़े देश शक्तिशाली इज़राइल का समर्थन कर आतंक का साथ दे रहे हैं” pic.twitter.com/F4bauFaBN8“We have seen an interesting nomenclature in several writings – one is being called a victim (aka Palestine) and another is dubbed as the victim of victims (aka Israel)… Both of them are accused of terrorism and both are victims…Powerful Israel, accused of occupation (in Gaza) is also a victim,” Ravish Kumar claimed. The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

17,09-Oct-23,"Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

19,04-Oct-23,"Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers","In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

20,04-Oct-23,Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms,"To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself.

21,27-Sep-23,When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule,"Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

22,25-Sep-23,"Canada: Parliament speaker apologises for celebrating a Nazi who killed Jews during WWII, Trudeau’s govt faces another humiliation","""Canada's Jewish community stands firmly with #Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. But we can't stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed"", the CIJA had shared on the Parliament's celebration of a Nazi criminal. On 24th September, Canadian Parliament speaker Anthony Rota apologised for celebrating a Nazi, Yaroslav Hunka, who had participated in the genocide against Jews during World War II. In his statement, Rota claimed that he was made aware of more information on Hunka that “caused” him to regret the decision to celebrate him. Furthermore, he claimed no one in the Parliament or among the Ukrainian delegation was aware of his intentions to celebrate Hunka during his address.On September 22, in the House of Commons, I recognized an individual in the gallery. I regret my decision to do so, and accept full responsibility for my actions. Read my statement here: https://t.co/Hd9chtHFNJHe said, “On Friday, 22nd September, in my remarks following the address of the President of Ukraine, I recognised an individual in the gallery. I have subsequently become aware of more information, which causes me to regret my decision to do so. I wish to make clear that no one, including fellow parliamentarians and the Ukraine delegation, was aware of my intention or of my remarks before I delivered them. This initiative was entirely my own, the individual in question being from my riding and having been brought to my attention. I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Earlier, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs expressed their concerns over the matter. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), they said, “We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. Canada’s Jewish community stands firmly with #Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. But we can’t stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed.”We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. #Canada's Jewish community stands…Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Official Opposition since 2022, has also raised objections to celebrating Hunka in the Parliament. He pointed out that Trudeau personally met and honoured Hunka. Accusing the ruling party of recognising a Nazi veteran on the floor of the House of Commons, he demanded an apology from the PM.It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division).Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognized on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the… https://t.co/9JFUEqsdW8He said, “It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division). Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognised on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the Ukrainian President. This is an appalling error in judgment on the part of Justin Trudeau, whose personal protocol office is responsible for arranging and vetting all guests and programming for state visits of this kind. No parliamentarians (other than Justin Trudeau) had the opportunity to vet this individual’s past before he was introduced and honoured on the floor of the House of Commons. Without warning or context, it was impossible for any parliamentarian in the room (other than Mr Trudeau) to know of this dark past. Mr. Trudeau must personally apologise and avoid passing the blame to others as he always does.”On 22nd September, the Canadian House of Commons gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a World War II veteran who fought for “Ukrainian independence” against Russian aggressors. This is how the speaker of the House, Anthony Rota, introduced him. The 98-year-old war veteran, however, was a member of a SS unit, the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”, established in 1943 by the Nazis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also present during the occasion. Notably, SS was the main paramilitary group under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany and was primarily responsible for tunning Holocaust operations. 14th SS-Volunteer Division Galicia was made up of volunteers, which means that Yaroslav Hunka joined the unit on his own will, and was not conscripted.The members of the First Ukrainian Division have been deemed war criminals by several experts. However, Canadian inquiry into their history did not recognise them as war criminals. Interestingly, there is clear evidence that Canada housed at least 3,000 war criminals. Canadian authorities established a commission to look into war criminals, and the commission headed by Justice Jules Deschenes submitted its report in December 1986 titled “Commission of Inquiry on War Crimes“. As per the report, the Canadian government had allowed over 2,000 war criminals from WWII to enter Canada despite the Canadian Jewish Congress’s opposition. The commission gave Hunko’s division “clean chit” due to the lack of evidence. 2014 Nazi Hunter Steve Rambam called Canada a safe haven for war criminals. Notably, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also called out Canada in a recent statement for giving shelter to terrorists and gangsters.

23,11-Oct-23,"Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar","During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands.

24,09-Oct-23,"Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power","After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

25,09-Oct-23,"As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip","Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

26,08-Oct-23,"‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra","Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar. At the same time, PSI Anirudh Kamaliya clarified, “An investigation is currently underway to find out whether Nilesh Parmar was involved in the Manjusar incident. However, Nilesh Parmar has been sent to Sabarmati jail under PASA after his name cropped up in complaints against both sides and his name cropped up in more than three similar offences.”On Thursday (28th September), there was an incident of stone pelting during Ganesh Visarjan at Manjusar in Savli taluka of Vadodara. In this incident, some Hindus were injured and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also broken. In this case, the police have registered an FIR against 18 people and the mob of the remaining 30 unidentified people and further investigation is underway. On the other hand, it has been learned through reports that 5 accused of stone-pelting have also been arrested.वडोदरा के मुंजसर मैं गणेश विसर्जन पर कल किए गए पथराव की तस्वीरें आयी सामने.पथराव करने वाले फ़िलहाल गाँव छोड़कर भाग निकले.पुलिस ने फ़िलहाल पाँच लोगो को पकड़ा है बाक़ियो को ढूँढा जा रहा है. https://t.co/y7GpjqiOup pic.twitter.com/GHJFnblQCpThe incident took place in Manjusar village of Savli. Videos of this incident have also surfaced on social media. In these videos, it is seen that miscreants wearing face masks threw stones from the roofs of the houses. Islamic posters were also put up in the building from where the stones were thrown. It is learnt that the stone pelters are currently absconding and efforts are on to trace them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

27,13-Oct-23,"Ladakh Congress working president justifies Hamas atrocities on innocent Israelis, tries to falsely project ‘Palestinian Mujahideens’ as victims","Umpteen visuals are available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery that Hamas has inflicted on Israeli civilians.Along the lines of his higher-ups in Delhi, Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress has declared his unwavering support for the Palestinians and their terrorist organisation Hamas, which has been committing horrific atrocities and war crimes against Israel since it launched an unprecedented attack on the nation on October 7. ‘Hamas Mujahideen from Gaza have started to take back their land from America’s pet Israel, killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire. The resolution however backed the Palestinian people’s rights.The Congress party’s official statement emphasised the process of “dialogue and negotiations” to resolve the problem between Israel and Palestine.India's Congress party comes in support of Palestine after a key meeting https://t.co/5XqyfamvVH“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people.

28,13-Oct-23,Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts,"CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

30,11-Oct-23,"IUML, which Rahul Gandhi called secular, extends support to Palestine even after Hamas beheads and rapes Israelis ","Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML).On Tuesday (10th October), the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) announced its support for Palestine while asserting that Israel’s ‘occupation’ of the state of Palestine is the main cause of the surging tensions in West Asia. In its resolution, IUML stated, “It is a hot reality that Israel’s occupation of Palestine is the root cause of the entire West Asian tensions.Moreover, the League claimed that Israel’s ‘encroachment’ of Khuds Mosque is “extremely unjustified”.Interestingly, while it was the Hamas terrorist organisation that launched an unprecedented attack on Israeli civilians this week, the IUML asserted that Israel is “not just against Palestine but against the entire global human community.” The IUML termed the Israel-Hamas conflict as a human rights issue.Furthermore, the IUML urged the United Nations to bring up a peaceful solution to the ‘Palestinian issue’ adding that India has always stood with Palestine.The party offered its “strong support to the Palestinian people and also expressed its protest over the “unfair developments” in Palestine.It is worth noting that the IUML which is an offshoot of the Muslim League that played a significant role in the partition of India is an ally of the Congress party. While the IUML has links with Jammat-e-Islami and the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), both accused by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) of spreading radicalism in Kerala, Rahul Gandhi had called the IUML a ‘secular’ party.During his controversial US visit in June this year, Rahul Gandhi asserted that the Muslim League, a Muslim political party in India which played a vital role in the partition of India on religious lines, was “completely secular”. The interviewer asked him, “You talked about secularism and democracy while opposing the Hindu party BJP, however, the Congress in Kerala has been in alliance with the Muslim party, the Muslim League in Kerala, the state from which you were an MP”. To this, Rahul Gandhi said, “Muslim League is a completely secular party, there is nothing non-secular about the Muslim League. I think the person has not studied the Muslim League”.Notably, while the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) claims to be born after Indian Independence in 1948, is actually an off-shoot of Pakistan founder and Islamist Mohammad Ali Jinnah’s All India Muslim League (AIML). The All India Muslim League was succeeded by the Muslim League in Pakistan and the Indian Union Muslim League in India. While the IUML on its website claims that it is “uncompromisingly anchors the nationalist and secular principles”, the party’s activities have been in sharp contrast to this.The IUML backing Palestine is not surprising since a Muslim party’s leaders feel religiously obligated to stand with the Ummah. On 9th October, the Congress party passed a resolution backing the Palestinian people while raising concerns over the situation.“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people. Violence of any type never provides a solution and must stop,” the Congress party said.Interestingly, the Congress party’s resolution did not even mention the words Hamas or Israel. Meanwhile, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor in a conversation with IndiaToday said that “Hamas cannot be called a terrorist organisation”. He asserted that while the US has labelled Hamas as a terrorist organisation, the government of India has not made any such classification. Tharoor’s assertion comes even when Prime Minister Modi has explicitly termed the attacks on Israel as “terrorist attacks”.Tharoor says- ""Can't label Hamas as Terrorist Organisation"" pic.twitter.com/BDOgZNfXatPerhaps out of political imperative to avoid upsetting the ‘vote bank,’ the Congress party cannot comprehend that Hamas holding innocent Israeli people hostage, killing children and families, and raping numerous civilians is terrorism.The recent Israel-Hamas war began on Saturday (7th October) when the State of Israel was attacked by the Palestine-based Islamic terror group Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya commonly known as Hamas, resulting in the deaths of over 1000 Israelis. Nearly 2400 people have been wounded, with dozens are still being held captive by the Hamas terrorists.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Both community members marched shoulder to shoulder as they unequivocally condemned terrorism. According to BNN Network, the protest was also organised to raise awareness about the ongoing conflict.Toronto Mayor Olivia Chow on 9th October released a statement saying that the rally organised in support of the terrorist organisation Hamas was an unsanctioned one and without a permit.Chow “unequivocally” denounced the rally and said that the Chief of Police has assured her that they will investigate the matter and address any suspected incidents of hate.Meanwhile, Canada’s Minister of Finance, Chrystia Freeland expressed support for the pro-Israel demonstrations. “We are in solidarity with you,” she reportedly said.The joint protests by Indians and Jews in Canada are significant for more reasons than one. Canada was recently in the headlines after the House of Commons gave a standing ovation to a former Nazi war criminal Yaroslav Hunka, who was posted in the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”.The incident opened the pandora’s box what with Canada’s history of sheltering Ukrainian nationalists who worked for Hitler’s Nazi army in the second world war. Notably, Chrystia Freeland’s grandfather, too, worked for a Nazi newspaper which was recruited for the Galicia Division of the Waffen-SS.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

32,13-Oct-23,Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

33,10-Oct-23,"There is no common brotherhood, only ‘common enemy’: How the Ummah ignores millions of Muslim victims but gets together against Jews, Hindus, and Christians","There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Arab world has rallied in support of Palestine. These countries have a long history of supporting the “Palestinian” cause. However, their support doesn’t stem from the perceived notion of religious fraternity and common brotherhood, colloquially referred to as the concept of Ummah instead it is driven by the hatred for dehumanised non-believers, pejoratively called ‘Kafirs’ (infidels) and shared theological believe of a common enemy. Conspicuously, the responses of the Arab world vis-a-vis alleged atrocities on Muslims by non-believers as against that of Muslims on Muslims underscores the exploitative and preposterous concept called “convenience of victimhood” to serve the end goal of justifying the ‘annihilation’ of non-believers. Here are some antecedents revealing how support for Palestine or Muslims being ‘persecuted’ around the world serves as just a tool to usher in Dar-ul-Islam and make the world ridden from infidelity.  Israel-Palestine neighbours Syria, Egypt, and Jordan among others have fought wars citing the cause of Palestinians, however, they all share a dark history of persecuting Palestinians on their soil or mercilessly committing crimes against the population, which they allege Israel commits against Palestinian Muslims. Evidently, on 17th September 1970, Jordan carried out a massacre of thousands of Palestinians which is notorious as ‘Black September’ for Palestinians. Fifty years ago, King Hussein ordered the Jordanian Army to massacre militants in the refugee camps situated around Amman. Following the royal orders, the Jordanian army launched a brutal crackdown in a bid to retake control of territory occupied by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) in Jordan.  According to the 2015 census data, there are around 634,000 Palestinians in Jordan out of the total population of 9.5 million. However, Human Rights organisations claim that half of the Jordan population is Palestinian. The ruling Hashemite dynasty of Jordan fears the large population of Palestinians in the country has the power to destabilise the empire.Meanwhile, Pakistan has a deep interest in supporting the Palestinian cause which increased, especially after India started strengthening its relationship with Israel in the 1990s. However, Pakistani leaders have avoided discussing this chapter in Palestinian history: the events of Black September in Jordan in 1970. Notably, Pakistan played a major hand in exterminating Palestinian ‘terrorists’ hiding in refugee camps. Jordan had sought the assistance of Pakistan to train its newly equipped army. As a result, the critical training for the Jordanian army was provided by Pakistan.Another neighbor, Syria which earlier used to mollycoddle Hamas, it acted against Palestinians when they exploited and aggravated civil war in Syria, the nation which was hosting them. Apparently, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. However, normal Gazans or Palestinians didn’t share the same fate as their top brass for participating in the Syrian Civil War. While the Hamas leadership was just shunned from the country, ordinary Palestinians (despite hailing from the Muslim faith) were brutally hacked to death. According to private data gathered by the Action Group for Palestinians of Syria (AGPS), they documented the death of at least 4,013 Palestinians as a result of the war in Syria. The victims included 614 refugees who had died of torture inside Syrian regime prisons and detention centres and 205 who had died due to lack of medical care and the tight siege imposed by the Syrian regime army on the Yarmouk camp in Damascus, the AGPS had revealed. Israeli politician Golda Meir once famously said, “We will have peace with the Arabs when they love their children more than they hate us”. The same does not just apply to Islamic countries, it also applies to Hamas (Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya) which uses the civilian population of Gazans to materialize their hatred for Jews.Notably, Hamas has been using civilian sites like hospitals, religious sites, or educational institutions to launch rocket or missile attacks and exploit civilians as cannon fodder. The Israeli Defence Forces demonstrated an example of a religious site that was hit by the Israeli Air Force as it was used by Hamas to launch a terror attack on Israel.Israeli civilians are not Hamas’ only victim.Hamas intentionally positions itself deep among Gaza's population. For example…this terrorist site that the Israel Air Force targeted, located next to a mosque and just a football field away from a school. pic.twitter.com/ROs3iMdnLzThe Rafah Border Crossing, also known as the Rafah Crossing Point, serves as the sole crossing point between Egypt and the Gaza Strip. It is located on the Gaza–Egypt border, which was recognised by the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty. However, Egypt has a long history of prohibiting Gazan refugees from entering its territory to avoid its negative security implications. Cairo which has suffered the brunt of Islamic State (IS) or Daesh, has feared infiltration of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Palestinians, particularly Gazan refugees. Even today, soon after the Hamas terrorists imposed an unprovoked war on Israel, Egyptian security closed this sole border crossing for Gazans. The reports of it were confirmed by the Israeli officials who had earlier asked the Gazans to cross over to Egypt in the wake of its retaliatory strikes on Hamas terror sites. However, later they had to clarify that the Rafah crossing was open yesterday, but now it is closed.BREAKING: Egypt has closed the Rafah crossing with Gaza's southern borderThe Rafah border crossing has remained predominantly closed since Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in June 2007. Even when Egypt makes some concessions, it only allows those who require medical treatment or have foreign residency permits to cross the borders, a move targeted toward Hamas terrorists. Do you know why #Egypt doesn't open the #Rafah border crossing with #Gaza to let 2.3 million Palestinians living there flee? This is because 8 out of every 10 Palestinian men living in #Gaza are terrorists or terrorism supporters! For years, Egypt has suffered from #ISIL/#Daesh,… pic.twitter.com/zD0C89d7pAStrikingly, the Egyptian fear revolving around the entry of Hamas terrorists in the guise of Gazan refugees stems from the fact that Hamas has in the past targeted the Rafah border and Egyptian border personnel including blowing it up with explosives. One such incident was reported on 23 January 2008, when Hamas terrorists in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah border crossing, destroying part of the 2003 wall.Meanwhile, Israel had already sealed its border crossings with the Palestinian enclave, allowing in only humanitarian aid and basic supplies which have been cut post the 7th October Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli citizens.Earlier, Hamas used to amass funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Notably, Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south and Rafah is the sole border crossing. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood, which is again a dreaded and designated terrorist organisation.  Afterward, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Recently, Jordan implemented a policy that can’t be further from the concept of “Common brotherhood” or the antithesis of catering to the Ummah brotherhood. Evidently, Jordan which was perceived as a host accepting millions of Palestinian, Iraqi, and Syrian refugees on the lines of the Universal Muslim Brotherhood, had taken a hard turn. Experts have pointed out that the “Jordan Initiative” unveiled in May will radically change Jordan from one of the world’s most accommodating hosts to one of its biggest proponents for sending refugees home. Regarding this, deputy director of the Middle East and North Africa division at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle said, “Jordan long has said that refugees are welcome. But now the official rhetoric has moved toward supporting their return. It’s a cause for significant concern.”Similarly, Lebanon and Turkey have speeded up the deportation of hundreds of Syrians, their Muslim brethren, since April to speed up their exodus from their so-called “pro-Ummah” nation.  Likewise, Pakistan, the vociferous proponent of Ummah, has recently asked millions of Afghan refugees to leave the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Afghan refugees who had fled their nation when the Taliban took over Kabul and had been living in Pakistan have been reportedly given only four weeks time to return, forcing them to choose between the brutalities of two co-religionist nations, Pakistan or Afghanistan.  On the basis of Ummah, persecuted Muslim citizens/refugees of war-torn Yemen should have garnered the same support as they have been suffering from a brutal war, starvation, and cholera that have been ruining lives. However, this is not the case because co-religionists are involved in this war and there is no “convenience of victimhood” involved in the Yemeni conflict to furtherance the cause of Dar-ul-Islam or fighting/killing the infidel. There is a war in Yemen, there is a war in Syria, there is a war in Sudan, and there is a war in Lybia. Muslims are killing Muslims in all these wars, thousands of victims, did you see any protests in New York, London, Berlin, ..? Why?Because for many Muslims they do not really…The same goes for Syrian, Sudanese, and Libyan refugees, Muslims being persecuted by terrorism in Africa and elsewhere, attract no whispers of support as they don’t have the binding clue – common enemy. Islamic nations like Pakistan, Iran, Turkiye, Palestine, Lebanon, etc have committed sins on their own native Muslim sects – Ahmediyas, Balochs, and Sindhis etc in Pakistan, Hamas killing dissenting Muslims and Fatah leadership, etc. Fighting for common brotherhood, persecuted Muslims and atrocities, and ethnic cleansing in Muslim countries by Muslim leadership have always been brushed under the carpet.     Instead, the outcry for atrocities is targeted at non-believers for causing hindrance to their dehumanising and Jihadi acts –reflected in the anti-Semitic, anti-Hindu, anti-Western (Christ-believing countries) calls, like “Gas the Jews”, asking Pakistanis to kill ‘Hindus’, death to Israel and “death to America” in the Iranian parliament.  Palestinian Islamic Scholar Nidhal Siam's Anti Hindu speechAnd they're Supporting Palestine pic.twitter.com/fdsQQGgs0hThe latest hatred towards the “common enemy” is clear from the fact that the Arab world has refrained from condemning the propensity of crime committed on innocent Israeli citizens. On 7th October, Hamas terrorists launched a war involving rocket barrages and ground invasion into Israeli territories killing unsuspecting Israelis and other foreign nationals present in their sight. In the catastrophic invasion of Israel, more than 700 Israeli citizens have lost their lives, hundreds of children, girls, and the elderly have been taken hostage with Hamas terrorists giving open threats to behead them and air the beheadings, rape being used as weapons of war, bared and bruised bodies of women being paraded in streets. Conspicuously, these assaults were inflicted on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah and the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War.There has been a shocking outpouring of support for Hamas around the world. Thousands of Muslims, regardless of their ethnicity and nationality, have gathered in the streets of Western nations, where they enjoy the privileges of democracy and freedom of expression, to declare open support for the brutal slaughter of women, children, and hundreds of unsuspecting civilians. Be it Australia or Canada, the UK or the USA, the Palestinian cause has seen overwhelming support. However, the same people have never stood for the millions of malnourished children in Yemen, they never cared for the little girls deprived of schooling in Afghanistan, or the Muslims victimized by terrorists in Africa. The global Muslim population conspicuously lacks concerns for legitimate human rights abuses and atrocities when the perpetrators are their own people. It only unites when the enemy is the “other”, the Jew, the Hindu, or the Christian. Simply put, they just want to see the end of non-believers, one excruciating death after another and Jews had always been the first in line followed by Hindus and Christians with rejected/outcasted Muslim sects like Ahmediyas in between. Iran’s fanatism to have nuclear power demonstrates that it just wants to destroy the Jewish state and to achieve that it is ready to spend dozens of Gazas and Palestinians and Lebanon etc. The first hallucination of the usage of nuclear arsenal will be on Israel, taking away the existence of their beloved Palestinian Muslim brethren, for whom such wars are claimed to be fought for and such brutality are being justified.    Meanwhile, in the non-Arab world, leaders from across the world, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Joe Biden have expressed their solidarity and support for Israel at its difficult hour. It wouldn’t be wrong to say that Common victimhood has become a tool, while common brotherhood is just a blatant lie, the only thing that unites the Muslim world, in general, is the hatred of the ‘common enemy’ – Israel, followed by Hindus and Christians with outcasted Muslim sects in between.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

34,06-Oct-23,The Hindu and how it is creating the North-South Divide: Repeatedly lying about devolution of funds and cheating their readers with misinformation,"Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. The Hindu published an article on 5th October 2023, with a very combative headline – “Retribution for the South, accolade for the North”. I think you got the gist just by looking at the headline. This article was a continuation of the oft-repeated argument by this ilk, that South India is superior to North India and yet the Government of India keeps rewarding North India and ignores South India.This particular article discusses the divisive argument through two subjects – the Delimitation of Lok Sabha Constituencies and the devolution of funds through Finance Commissions. While discussing these two subjects, the article stands out for some really unique arguments. The first is how it changes our understanding of basic geography itself. Sample this core argument at the beginning of the article:The authors, one of whom is a professor, have miraculously decided that the Gujarati-speaking Western state of Gujarat is actually a Hindi-speaking Northern State for the sake of their argument. I kept on thinking as to why they would make this fundamental error. Is it to bolster their argument that the 4% increase in population in a certain group of states is because of Gujarat? Turns out, it is not. Even if Gujarat is not included in this elite list, the core argument (a 4% increase in population share) will stay as strong. This is not the first time this ilk has tried to alter our fundamental understanding of Geography. Prashant Kishor, in an interview with Shekhar Gupta, enlightens us that “Hindi heartland has now extended to Western India in Gujarat, Maharashtra, and Karnataka”. How does Karnataka remotely get classified as a “Hindi heartland” and more importantly a “Western state”? How do Gujarat and Maharashtra get into the bracket of “Hindi heartland” when crores of people in these states speak and take pride in their own languages? Can you imagine if powerful commentators (such as Shekhar Gupta) and publications (such as The Hindu) could lie like this in today’s day and age, what must they have done back then when they were even more powerful? It is perplexing that they think their reader will not see through this chicanery. This bogey of labelling random states as “Hindi speaking” and altering their geography, merely because they vote for the BJP is really a sad reflection of the mental state of these commentators. But why exactly are they altering the fundamentals of geography like this? The essence is captured in these two paragraphs – South Indian states will lose out on their share of representation in the Lok Sabha post delimitation. Recently, India Today also put up a graphic on their website giving out some numbers on how South’s representation will come down if population is the criteria. This was dutifully picked up by the divisive politicians from the South. All of them are making one fundamental assumption that the number of Lok Sabha seats will remain constant at 543. It has been discussed at various forums that the number of Lok Sabha seats will increase from the current 543. It doesn’t make sense for us to have the same number of seats when our population was 50 crores versus when it is 140 crores! The new Lok Sabha building can accommodate 888 MPs – surely, they have built it with the purpose of increasing the seats from the existing 545. Instead of telling the readers about these possibilities, the English media is purposely fomenting hatred by discussing only one remote possibility.  Now, the authors of The Hindu could not fill up enough space with only one bogus argument, so they decided to repeat the lie about the devolution of funds through the 15th Finance Commission (FC). The core argument is just in one paragraph highlighted below:From 1975 till 2015, all finance commissions (7th to 13th) took the 1971 census as a reference. You must actually be wondering what relevance would the 1971 census have in 2015. This statistic actually reflects the status quoist mindset of the Congress party. But we digress. The Modi government did the logical thing of mandating to partial use the latest 2011 census data from 2015-2020 (14th FC) and fully use it from 2020 onwards (15th FC). Ever since this gang started screaming that the South States “lost the advantage despite doing good on population control. Controversial website Wire even went to the extent of claiming that “It is becoming almost untenable for Tamil Nadu and Kerala to thrive in the Indian union as rational, self-interested sub-units.”On peripheral reading, you would actually think that this is a logical argument and be wondering why I am being so banal about it. In fact, if you read the article snippet pasted above from The Hindu, you would also assume that the Modi government hasn’t incorporated this logical argument at all, and is, therefore, anti-South India, fascist and whatnot. Guess what? The 15th Finance Commission has reduced the weightage allotted to only the population and has added a new criterion to actually reward states that have done well on controlling the population. Take a look at the comparison table below (the highlighted portion indicates the new criteria).Demographic Performance refers to how states have performed with respect to population control. Simply put, you will be rewarded if you control your population better – which is exactly what the article in The Hindu is arguing for! The “tax effort” incentivizes states that have done well in tax collection efforts. This parameter is back in the 15th FC (after not being considered in the previous 3 FCs). The moot question therefore is this – Why have the authors of The Hindu piece intentionally not told the readers about this most important piece of information? Why have the editors published this lie-filled article when the fundamental premise itself has no basis? What do these people gain by fomenting such hate between regions of India? If anything, the Narendra Modi government has revolutionized the manner in which funds are devolved to the states. The states used to get 32% of the central share until the 13th FC period (ends 2015). From 2015 onwards, the states got a whopping 41% share. The percentage increase in the share is one aspect. Because of buoyant tax collections, as part of this 41% share, the states received a whopping 69.60 lakh crores (2014 to 2023) as opposed to just 18.50 lakh crores in the 2004 to 2014 period. Instead of focusing on meaningful criticism, our English media has now been reduced to repeatedly lying and cheating their readers. It is tiresome to listen to their repeated lies but then it is also important to repeatedly counter their lies too. Thankfully, the citizens of our country are much more intelligent than these hate-mongers in the English media. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

35,04-Oct-23,"From KCR’s offer to join NDA to Tribal Uni, a promise made by UPA: Two Telangana visits, explosive revelations by PM Modi will change the political game","No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Even by Prime Minister Modi’s hectic travel standards, it is unlikely that he will visit the same state in a span of 3 days. So, when his itinerary was announced for his visits to Telangana on October 1st and 3rd, it certainly created excitement amongst the cadre and inquisitiveness among the media. And true to the expectations, Prime Minister Modi made some explosive revelations and announced some critical projects that are bound to change the nature of discourse in Telangana politics. On October 3rd, Prime Minister Modi revealed that Chief Minister KCR had approached him, after BRS’s loss in GHMC elections in the year 2020, with an offer to join the NDA in exchange for support in the GHMC council. He has also asked the media to check out the dates to validate his claim (the dates do check out. The results were declared on December 5th, and KCR met Modi on Dec. 12th). This offer was rejected by the Prime Minister and the BJP chose to sit in the opposition. Prime Minister Modi has also told us that KCR informed him that he plans to make KTR the CM and wanted Modi’s blessings for the same. The timing of this revelation also checks out because there were multiple leaks to the media in January 2021 that the coronation of KTR is right around the corner. The idea had to be dropped by KCR owing to severe resistance from within the party and his extended family too. The Prime Minister’s revelations have to be seen in the context of the growing narrative in the state that the BRS and BJP are friends and not foes! The mind really boggles at how the Congress party was very successful in spreading this narrative. The chief reason being cited was that despite multiple interrogations by the ED, KCR’s daughter Kavitha has not been arrested yet in the now famous Delhi Liquor Scam. The ED chargesheet does talk about a “South Group” of which Kavitha is a part, that arranged for 100 crores in bribes in exchange for licenses. The BJP cadre was finding it very difficult to counter this argument. And around the same time, the popular and vociferous BJP President Bandi Sanjay Kumar was replaced – thus adding more fuel to the narrative that this was done at the behest of a BRS-BJP understanding! The Prime Minister’s revelations have certainly come as a boost for the party cadre, but his announcements on October 1st in Telangana were no less significant and were equally narrative-setting in nature. Until the year 2021, Telangana was the highest turmeric-producing state in India. The people of Nizamabad district had a demand for nearly 15 years that a Turmeric board be set up in Nizamabad so that the turmeric farmers here get better opportunities and rates to sell Turmeric. There is this farmer who took a vow in the year 2011 that he will walk barefoot till the Turmeric Board is set up in Nizamabad. KCR’s daughter, Kavitha fought the 2014 Lok Sabha elections from Nizamabad promising them that she will bring the Turmeric board. She failed to do so (among her many failures) and she eventually lost the 2019 election to BJP’s Dharmapuri Arvind.D. Arvind signed a bond paper to the people of Nizamabad that he would resign if he failed to bring the Turmeric Board and also a good MSP for Turmeric. Though the central government announced the setting up of a Spices Board regional office in Nizamabad, it didn’t cut any ice with the voters. As has been the trend with the Modi government, where long pending issues are resolved quickly, Prime Minister Modi has announced on October 1st, the setting up of the National Turmeric Board in Nizamabad. This took the BRS by surprise because they were all busy making jokes about how Arvind failed to get the Turmeric board and how his bond paper was now a joke. With this announcement, one of the key demands of thousands of farmers in Nizamabad stands fulfilled. In fact, the setting up of a Turmeric board in general has been a demand even in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra. This is the first time in 36 years that a board is being set up specifically for a product. The second major announcement was of setting up a Central Tribal University in Telangana. You may be wondering what is so major about setting up a university. This university was promised in the AP Reorganisation Act of 2014 bought by the UPA. Despite swift approvals from the Modi government, the BRS government delayed land acquisition. And yet BRS started shouting from the rooftops that it is the Modi government that is doing grave injustice to Telangana by not granting the university! After 9 years of dilly-dallying by the KCR government (nicely captured in this thread), the Central Tribal University has finally become a reality. The Prime Minister had to make repeated mentions of the Congress party (both in his speeches and tweets) in these two days because it was important to remind people of the corrupt and inept Congress party. These steps were necessitated also because of both the stagnating fortunes of the BJP and the rise of the Congress in Telangana. No one in Telangana was ready for the political bombshells or the administrative surprises. It is now up to the state BJP unit to take this message forward. Will these get converted to votes? Time will only tell! Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

36,02-Oct-23,"Son of a Congress leader, Fareed Zakaria, who had called for foreign interference in India, now whitewashes Khalistani terrorist Nijjar","While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. On Monday (October 2), CNN released an episode of India-born US journalist Fareed Zakaria pontificating on the diplomatic row between India and Canada following Justin Trudeau’s absurd allegations against New Delhi. In the 5-minute video, the son of Former Congress Minister Rafiq Zakaria, Fareed Zakaria goes on at length to whitewash Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar. He trivialises the real threat of Khalistani terrorism by casting aspersions over the authenticity and gravity of the danger they pose to India’s national security and the lives of patriotic Indians inside and outside India.  Today’s last look: why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India pic.twitter.com/brVKd0QjzoZakaria also accused India of indulging in jingoism over the Canadian allegation and implies that the Khalistani terrorism issue is being exaggerated for political gains by PM Modi and BJP in the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections in 2024. Zakaria begins by quoting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, where he had accused India of being involved in the killing of Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar, on Canadian soil. He then goes on to whitewash Hardeep Singh Nijjar by briefly describing him as a Sikh “activist” and head of a Sikh temple (Gurudwara) and tries to say that he was gunned down by unidentified assailants in June in the temple’s parking lot. Zakaria sidestepped the fact that Nijjar had an Interpol arrest warrant against his name as early as November 2014 for being involved in serious offenses like murder, among a host of other illegal activities. Zakaria deliberately omits the fact that Trudeau was pandering to Khalistani terrorists by raising the issue of Khalistani terrorist Nijjar’s killing with India for political reasons. While giving a political spin to India’s response to the issue, he didn’t mention the alliance between the NDP and the Liberal party. Jagmeet Singh’s NDP is a known party of Khalistani sympathisers in India.Instead, he presented Trudeau’s absurd allegations against India as a move to get Justice for Nijjar. He claimed that the motive of Justin Trudeau in making these allegations was to shame the Indian government by airing these allegations publicly and compel it to cooperate in the investigation.  In fact, he had earlier given a call to the US government to directly interfere in India’s internal affairs. He advocated for (the US govt) to ally with India’s businesses, press, NGOs, and cultural groups, indirectly hinting that the US government should invest in regime change tactics instead of seeking healthy bilateral relations with India. Back then, he had also targeted India for focusing on its own national interest insinuating that the ideal ally of the US should prioritise US interests above its own interests.Later in the video, he delves into, “why Trudeau’s startling allegations are playing out very differently in Modi’s India”. Citing some snippets from Indian media and political analysts, he laments that these stories have “released a spasm of Jingoism”. He then goes on to paint a contrasting picture of Canada as seen from a Western lens vis-a-vis how India has started to portray Canada as – “a safe haven for terrorists.”  In the video, Zakaria states, “In India, the reactions are very different and reveal in fact that Justin Trudeau blew it. Just look at the Indian press, the story has released a spasm of Jingoism in which TV anchors cast Canada not as a multicultural haven and stable democracy, you and I may know but as a rogue state bent on protecting terrorists.” To highlight this point, he plays the clip of Arnab Goswami where he referred to Justin Trudeau as a supporter of terrorism, an open terror backer, and a terrorist sympathiser and added that he is at the point of no return. Zakaria argues that political analyst Sushant Sareen has aptly described the Country’s reaction, “if we did it, it was right, if we didn’t do it, you are wrong.” If we did it, it was right; if we didn’t, you were wrong https://t.co/0btTVWeAlDArguing that with this case, India is misrepresenting itself as a victim of Western bullying on the domestic front, Zakaria added, “An analysis peace of the Hindustan Times conjures up memories of Western colonial powers ganging up against India claiming that Khalistani terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar’s killing will be a rallying point for the Anglo-Saxon bloc to come together against India.”  While explaining to his audience why India was accusing Canada of providing a safe haven to terrorists, he downplays the Khalistani terrorism in the name of a separate homeland, ‘Khalistan’. He blatantly lies by mainstreaming the fringe Khalistanis by claiming that Nijjar was one among many foreign-based Sikhs who advocate for Khalistan.    Regarding this, he said, “Indian officials have accused Canada of providing a safe haven for terrorists, that might sound like a puzzling and absurd allegation but it is a reference to the fact that Nijjar was a Sikh separatist. One of many Sikhs abroad who advocate for a separate country for Sikhs, the homeland they want to create, Khalistan, the idea that goes back decades, the efforts include armed militancy in India that peaked in the 1980s.”  Subsequently, he whitewashes the ongoing crimes and public calls for violence against Hindus by Khalistani elements. For this, he mischievously downplays by quoting The Economist which claimed that Khalistan is merely an “idle talking point” in the Sikh diaspora.    He said, “As the Economist notes, the movement for Khalistan was responsible for the death of thousands in the 1980s and 1990s but has since been little more than an idle talking point in the Sikh diaspora and has negligible support in India.”Casting aspersions on India’s concern regarding national security and the lives of Indian nationals abroad, Fareed Zakaria goes on to say that Canada catering to India’s demand to act tough on Khalistani elements would be “politically useful” for PM Modi and BJP.  He said, “Whatever the reality in this one case, tensions between India and Canada over “Sikh activists” in the Indian diaspora have been long-running. As the FT notes, India’s accusations that Canada has been too soft on “Sikh activists” deserve some scrutiny. But it is also true that playing up this kind of threat to India is politically useful for PM Narendra Modi and his party BJP.”  Citing the example of the Pulwama terror attack and subsequent response by India, he argues that Trudeau’s strategy to seek justice by naming and shaming India is fundamentally flawed. Painting ‘Hindu Nationalism’ as anti-minority and anti-West, he sermonises, “You see Justin Trudeau’s whole strategy of naming and shaming India fundamentally misunderstands the dynamics of Modi’s Hindu nationalism which is rooted in the belief that India’s Hindu majority has been passive for too long in the face of minorities and foreigners. When presented with an opportunity, Modi knows how to translate it into political gold.”  He continued, “In 2019 a suicide bomber carried out the worst attack in decades killing dozens of Indian soldiers, India blamed Pakistan militants and sent in the Indian Airforce and carried out strikes on what it said was a militant training facility in Pakistan. Though Pakistan denied the strikes hit much of anything. Nonetheless, it was the first time that such a cross-border operation had been carried out in almost fifty years.”  Connecting the dots of then vs. now, and indirectly underscoring the fact that Canada is becoming new Pakistan for India, Zakaria concluded by lamenting that this portrayal that Modi is standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying will be an election plank for him, regardless that it might not be real or dangerous.  Fareed Zakaria ranted, “As Bloomberg noted, Modi went on a victory lap, saying in a campaign speech that he believed in barging into the house of terrorists and killing them. He implied without any evidence that the opposition parties’ sympathies lay with the terrorists. Pollsters reported a boost in Modi’s approval ratings after the strike. Now Modi faces another election, and he will surely be helped if he can run by standing against Sikh separatism and Western bullying, regardless of how real or dangerous either threat actually is.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

37,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

38,07-Oct-23,Fact Check: Did 121 people die because of the shutting down of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi,"Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. Days after the Allahabad High Court stayed the suspension on the licence of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi, social media was rife with disinformation about the death of 121 people in the Munshiganj area of the city.On Friday (6th October), a propaganda news outlet by the name of ‘4 pm’ interviewed an alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, who made outrageous claims about the death of 121 patients due to lack of medical attention.An alleged nursing staffer by the name of Saurabh Mishra claimed that a whopping 121 residents of Amethi died due to the closure of the hospital. “Some are dying en route to Lucknow, others are not getting medicines on time. There are not even cotton swabs and bandages,” he claimed “Around 121 patients have died in just 15 days,” Mishra continued. “This is the politics of vengeance…They (BJP) hate Gandhis,” he brazened out. Prior to him, another alleged employee of the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital named Umashankar Pandey claimed that the licence of the medical facility was suspended due to the BJP’s disdain for the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty.“Smriti Irani (MP from Amethi constituency) hates the fact that ‘Gandhi’ name is attached to the hospital. Now, they (BJP) are hurting the employability of small-time workers,” he was heard as saying. After the clips of the video went viral online, the Congress system exploited the opportunity to create hysteria about the supposed death of more than 120 people in Amethi.It must be mentioned that the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi is run by the Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Trust (SGMT), which is headed by Congress supremo Sonia Gandhi.Congress loyalist Shantanu claimed, “In hate of Rahul Gandhi and the Gandhi family, @smritiirani and the BJP govt of Uttar Pradesh took lives of 121 people as the functioning of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital was stopped…” He later deleted his tweet.flesh alive passed the sell by date.The max sucking power of her throat and lungs it's all down hill from here,1.6 B Indian slaves being treated like animals.Shame on dirty Indian politics/politicians.Feku &Gang should be hanged, not worth living on planet earth.Sooner the betterOther propaganda artists also shared the claims about the death of 121 patients. On Friday (6th October) night, the District Magistrate & Collector of Amethi, Rakesh Kumar Mishra, rubbished the false claims being propagated on social media.एकदम भ्रामक एवं गलत बात कही जा रही है। किसी की मृत्यु नहीं हुई हैं। जनपद अमेठी के सभी सरकारी चिकित्सालयों में दवा आदि की कोई कमी नहीं है। तथ्य के विपरीत जनस्वास्थ्य के बारे में अफवाह फैलाने के विरूद्ध वैधानिक कार्यवाही की जाएगी ।“Completely misleading and wrong things are being shared. No one has died. There is no shortage of medicines in any government hospital of Amethi district,” he informed. “Legal action will be taken against spreading rumours about public health contrary to facts,” the District Magistrate of Amethi warned.Earlier in September this year, the Sanjay Gandhi Hospital in Amethi came under the scanner over the death of a 22-year-old woman named Divya Shukla. The victim went into a state of coma after being administered anaesthesia, prior to a kidney stone operation.Shukla was then referred to Medanta Hospital in Lucknow, where she eventually passed away. The district administration ordered the closure of the hospital, citing medical negligence, and directed the suspension of OPD and emergency services. A case was also registered against 4 employees of Sanjay Gandhi Hospital for negligence. On Wednesday (4th October), the Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court put the order of the district administration on hold and directed the resumption of services.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

39,25-Sep-23,‘Kapil Dev kidnapped or Harsh Bhogle-type promotional stunt?’ See how Netizens react to a viral video showing goons taking him away,"As soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir's timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha BhogleOn Monday, September 25, a 0.07-second video clip took the internet by storm. The video which quickly went viral showed a person resembling cricket legend Kapil Dev, who had his hands tied and mouth strapped being manhandled and taken away by two goons. Cricketer turned politician Gautam Gambhir shared the clip on X, formally Twitter as he enquired about the World Cup-winning captain’s well-being. However, as soon as the video went viral, netizens started flooding Gautam Gambhir’s timeline hoping that it was a promotional stunt similar to what happened last year with cricket pundit Harsha Bhogle.Sharing the video Gautam Gambhir wrote, “Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev and that Kapil Paaji is fine!” along with a fingers-crossed emoji.Anyone else received this clip, too? Hope it’s not actually @therealkapildev 🤞and that Kapil Paaji is fine! pic.twitter.com/KsIV33DbmpIn the 0.07-second clip, a man in a light blue t-shirt and checkered trousers is seen being carried away by two goons. The man, who resembles Kapil Dev, has his wrists tied behind him and his mouth strapped with a piece of cloth. The man turns around for a fraction of a second, revealing his face. He offers a helpless look as the two men drag him inside a dingy house.While no official statement has been issued regarding the viral video, numerous followers on social media have claimed that it is nothing more than a promotional gimmick. Advertisment lol😅😅No one falls for it nowMany Netizens reacted angrily, slamming the ad firm for the lame video and praying and hoping for the cricket legend’s well-being and safety. These ex cricketers are selling themselves for ad money. Some are selling gutkhas while others are doing these cheap ads. ShameSeeing Kapil Dev kidnapped in a viral clip is worrying every cricket fan. Hoping it's fictional, not real crime. If just an attention-grabbing ad, the creators should apologize for causing such distress irresponsibly.#KapilDev #ResponsibleMarketing https://t.co/WwmRLauk1pDisgusting way for viewership, atleast respect our legends 👍Some were quick to recall a video from last year that showed cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle abruptly disappearing while speaking to a sports portal via video link. Just as it was eventually revealed that Harsha Bhogle’s video was a promotional gimmick, many Netizens were convinced that this was a re-run of last year’s act.It looks like an ad.. Hopefully it is They did this earlier with Harsha too.A similar video that had left Netizens worrying, had emerged in March 2022, wherein cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle suddenly disappeared while talking to a sports portal via video link. Harsha Bhogle was talking to cricketsportwalkin on an Instagram live session on March 24, 2022, when suddenly he disappeared from the screen after the camera apparently fell to the ground with a blurry image. However, later it was revealed that it was a promotional stunt that went wrong, as people started genuinely worrying about him.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

40,24-Sep-23,Fact Check: TMC leader Kirti Azad passes off old photo of BJP workers as ‘Sanghis protesting against Canada outside Canara Bank’,"In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.On Sunday (September 24), Trinamool Congress leader Kirti Azad courted controversy after he falsely claimed that BJP workers mistook Canara Bank for Canada and had been protesting outsides its premises.In a tweet (archive), the 64-year-old politician wrote, “BJP Sanghis assumed Canara Bank to be Canada and held demonstrations in front of the bank’s building.” The tweet was accompanied by a picture of a group of people, standing outside Canara Bank with BJP flags in hand.At the time of writing, the contentious tweet had more than 2000 likes and 500 retweets. The former cricketer-turned-politician sought to exploit the ongoing diplomatic tension between India and Canada to score political brownies.A quick ‘reverse Google image search’ of the image led us to a news report, published by Tamil daily ‘Maalai Malar’. The said report was published on August 30, 2020 i.e. 3 years ago.At the very onset, it became clear that the picture shared by Kirti Azad had nothing to do with the ongoing diplomatic standoff between India and Canada. The Maalai Malar report stated that BJP workers held demonstrations in Ooty against the city administration for removing a flagpole, which was installed to hoist the party flag. The municipality had alleged that no prior permission was sought from them by the BJP. Thus, it clearly shows that the BJP workers were not protesting against Canada in any form or manner. It is also interesting to note that the original picture was photoshopped with another image of Canara Bank by Kirti Azad to lend credence to his dubious claims.This is however not the first time that Kirti Azad has resorted to peddling fake news on social media. Earlier in February 2022, he falsely claimed that BJP leaders were being thrashed by the common people during the second phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh. In reality, the video is not from Uttar Pradesh but from the State of West Bengal. The victim in the incident was BJP leader Anirban Ganguly, who informed that he was attacked by Trinamool Congress-sponsored Jihadis. Hi Kirti, amusing to see that you,Bhagwat Jha Azad’s son,can’t distinguish between the hinterlands of #WestBengal & #UttarPradesh!This is clip of a jihadi attack engineered by TMC on me on Election Day, April 30 2021.Having become a FAMILY DOORMAT you have lost your rationality! https://t.co/qfkH1XGlV4In October 2022, Kirti Azad shared a fake quote attributed to RSS leader MS Golwalkar on Twitter, which claimed that he was willing to tolerate British subjugation but not a government in the nation that granted Muslims and Dalits equal status.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

41,11-Oct-23,"The New York Times publishes a report calling Hamas ‘terrorists’, changes to ‘gunmen’ after some time","There is no mention in the NYT report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel's air defence system Iron Dome.On Tuesday (10th October) The New York Times published a news regarding the terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel. In this story, The New York Times called Hamas ‘terrorists’. However, it replaced the word ‘terrorists’ with ‘gunmen’ after some time, in line with the left-liberal media policy of not using the term terrorist for jihadi terrorists.The news article titled ‘Hamas Leaves Trail of Terror in Israel’ was published on 10th October by The New York Times. In the subtitle of the article, the American newspaper wrote, “As Israeli soldiers regain control of areas near Gaza that came under attack, they are finding evidence seen in videos and photos and confirmed by witness accounts of the massacre of civilians by Hamas terrorists.”After some time, The New York Times changed the last word in the sentence ‘terrorist’ to ‘gunmen’. The NYT was called out on social media for calling terrorists just gunmen in order to score Islamoapologetic secular credentials. American journalist Greg Price wrote, “Holy shit you can’t make this up. The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen”.” Greg Price also shared the screenshots of the news before and after the change.The archive of the report shows the term ‘terrorist’ used by NYT before it was replaced.🚨Holy shit you can’t make this up.The New York Times published a story referring to Hamas as “terrorists” and then changed it to “gunmen.” pic.twitter.com/zp7vQUrHn3Interestingly, while the original report used the term ‘terrorist’ in the subtitle, it was used only once in the report, while the word ‘gunmen’ was used throughout the report. The publication has not replaced the lone occurrence of the term terrorist in the report, which appears in the second paragraph. The word ‘gunmen’ appears 8 times in the report text, sometimes called ‘Palestinian gunmen’ or ‘Hamas gunmen’. There is no mention in the report that Hamas also fired over 5,000 rockets into Israel, many of which hit civilian areas after overwhelming Israel’s air defence system Iron Dome.Referring to the 9/11 terrorist attack in the USA, Greg Price also wrote, “Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.”Untold pain suffering was caused by the amateur pilots on 9/11.Another X user with handle ID @WithRitesh posted, “Learning from their brothers across Atlantic!

This is Left Media! pic.twitter.com/SBduohHT95Syzmon Thomas posted, “Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt. I am glad they are slowly, but surely, going the way of the newspaper.” He also added a screenshot of news by the Washington Post calling ISIS terrorist Abu Bakr Al Baghdadi an ‘austere religious scholar’. The words used for the ISIS terrorist were later changed to ‘extremist leader’ after the news outlet faced criticism.Our media is contemptible and morally bankrupt.

It has repeatedly provided a platform for Islamic bigotry. In April 2021, NYT published a news article that said that the onus to convert is on non-Muslims in case of an interfaith marriage involving a Muslim and a non-Muslim.The New York Times is also notorious for its anti-India anti-Modi agenda. In March 2023, the New York Times published an article written by Anuradha Bhasin, the Executive Editor of The Kashmir Times who criticized PM Modi’s stance against the Indian media and its freedom of expression. Donning an anti-India outlook on the international media platform, she alleged that the Modi-led government had imposed ‘repressive’ media policies in the country and was deliberately targeting the media organizations who chose to voice an opinion against it or the Prime Minister.The Union Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Youth Affairs, and Sports Anurag Thakur lashed out at the New York Times for this anti-India editorial published on 8th March 2023. Anurag Thakur had said, “We don’t need to learn the grammar of democracy from agenda-driven media.” Now, The New York Times has called the Hamas terrorists as gunmen. The recent Israel-Hamas war started after the State of Israel came under attack by Palestine-based Islamic terror outfit Hamas on Saturday (7th October), resulting in the death of more than 900 Israelis. About 2400 people have been wounded and over 100 still remain in the captivity of the terrorists. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

The former ‘scribe’ made a case for Hamas by claiming that the terror organisation in Palestine is not as ‘powerful’ as Israel. “Now imagine the flight of those who are weak (in front of Israel)…Most nations are with Israel and it is still the victim of ‘victims.’ Not even a handful of countries are with Palestine,” he brazened out.In a bid to pacify his large follower base of Hamas sympathisers, Ravish Kumar inquired, “Are these countries doing justice (by siding with Israel) or amplifying terror (of Israel) in the name of combating terrorism?”“एक महीना पहले, नेतन्याहू को जनता का समर्थन नहीं था।सवाल पूछा जाना चाहिए कि हमास अंदर कैसे आ गया, और इसका जवाब इज़राइल के जवाब में मिलेगा”रवीश घूमा-फिरा के बता रहे हैं कि हमला करवा कर नेतन्याहू अपनी सरकार बचा रहे।सिर्फ रवीश ऐसी घटिया सोच रख सकता। pic.twitter.com/1oWiFlBb0RLater in his monologue, the YouTuber insinuated that the Benjamin Netanyahu-led Israeli government orchestrated the attacks on its citizens for political mileage. “Even a month ago, Netanyahu did not have this level of popular support…Should we leave this question out as to how Hamas intruded into the border of Israel? I am sure the answer to this question…” he cast aspersions on Israel instead of questioning Hamas terrorists.Ravish Kumar made the contentious remarks during his 39-minute-long rant on his YouTube channel on Monday (9th October).Similar claims were earlier peddled by ‘journalist’ turned politician Prashant Kanojia, who alleged, “Elections in Israel are going to take place soon. The current Israeli Prime Minister is also a coward like the Prime Minister of another nation. He also wants to attack his own citizens and win elections.”This is not the first time that Ravish Kumar has resorted to whitewashing extremists, responsible for widespread violence. In August 2020, he tried to absolve the radical Islamists of their complicity in the Bengaluru riots.In his usual sober voice, which helps propaganda sound seamlessly soothing, Ravish claimed on Friday, “Jo dangai hota hai vo dangai hota hai. Na toh unha Hindu mazhab see koi matlab hota hai na hi koi Muslim mazhab see koi matlab hota hai (A rioter is a rioter. He has nothing to due with Hindusim or Islam.)”Ravish further claimed, “Rioters look for a reason to be provoked. Those who know this game plan are well acquainted with the fact that a post can attract mobs who will unleash.” Through his claims, Ravish tried to deny the ‘communal angle’ in the Bengaluru carnage. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

44,09-Oct-23,"Former Indian Express journalist Irena Akbar floats conspiracy theory, claims that deceased Shani Louk wore bikini and was not stripped by Hamas terrorists","It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,"" the former Indian Express 'journalist' said.A day after Hamas terrorists stripped a German woman and paraded her dead body on a pickup truck, former Indian Express ‘journalist‘ Irena Akbar came out in defence of the terrorists on Sunday (8th October) morning.In a tweet, she wrote, “The woman, whose body was being taken in a pick-up truck, has been identified as Shani Louk, a German-Israeli dual citizen who was reportedly attending a music festival. First, this is NOT an etiquette of war in Islam to attack women, and hence this is condemnable.”The ex-scribe put out a token condemnation over the death of Louk only because ‘attacking women during war’ is supposedly against the tenets of Islam. Then, she proceeded to suggest that the victim was not stripped as she was not ‘fully naked.’One would have to suspend disbelief to believe what this woman is defending here. But, it is par for the course. Don’t underestimate the cruelty of the women of the barbaric cult. They are assigned various roles. One is the defence of a murder, the other is grooming in the… pic.twitter.com/ig50LljpwI“The woman is not fully naked, as parts of her upper & lower body are covered. If you check the Instagram account of Shani Louk (@shanukkk), you would see pictures she posted of herself wearing bikins or other skin-exposing outfits,” Irena Akbar brazened it out.She claimed that the victim could have been ‘partially naked’ at the time of her killing and not necessarily stripped by Hamas terrorists. “It could be possible that when she was killed, she was wearing a bikini or other skin-exposing garment,” the former Indian Express ‘journalist’ said.“…I am being factual here, based on evidence from her own Instagram account where she would post pictures of herself in such clothes. So, it cannot be ruled out that Shani (with all due respect to her) was wearing a bikini or other similar garment when she was killed or captured,” she further alleged.Irena Akbar wrote, “And hence, it is possible that she was NOT stripped by the Hamas militants. However, as Islam prescribes modesty for women and men, and respect for the dead, the militants should have covered her body with a cloth or sheet, and treated it respectfully, or not attack her at all.”She then resorted to mental gymnastics and asked why people, who hail bikinis as a symbol of ‘freedom’, are raising concerns about seeing a woman’s uncovered body. The ex- Indian Express ‘journalist’ conveniently glossed over the fact that the victim was murdered, stripped and paraded by Hamas terrorists.“So, let’s be fair before jumping to outrage, or celebration. Also, I have a question for non- Muslims: You often share pictures of bikini- clad Iranian women on beaches before the Islamic Revolution of 1979. You lament that the women were “free and liberated” in Iran before Shariah law was adopted,” Akbar remarked.“You use the bikini as a symbol of freedom and liberation for Muslim women of Iran, and you contrast that with the hijab, a symbol of “oppression” under Iran’s mandatory hijab law. So, why do you have a problem when Shani Louk was possibly wearing a bikini (when she was sadly captured)?” she brazened out.“Why do you have a problem when her almost-naked body could be publicly seen? Are you again using a woman’s uncovered body to make a point against Palestinians, and Muslims?” the former ‘scribe’ concluded.In April 2021, Irena Akbar stirred the hornet’s nest by thanking Allah for the Coronavirus pandemic. She claimed “If it weren’t for Covid, Indian Muslims would’ve been in detention camps. I’m NOT being grateful for the virus which killed my aunt, sent my dad to the ICU & is causing tragedies across homes. I’m stressing the fact that while fascists were making their plans, God was making His.”“It’s between the devil & the deep blue sea for IMs. Either die/live in fear of Covid OR die/live in fear of anti-Muslim state violence. At least the former doesn’t specifically target us & the public will eventually question the state. But in latter, the public would rejoice it,” she added.In February 2020, she asserted that Dalits should never be trusted by the Muslim community. The Islamist claimed that the Dalits were the ‘foot soldiers’ when communal riots broke out in Gujarat in 2002 after a Muslim mob engineered the Godhra train carnage.“They did the dirty job of gang-raping and killing Muslims. I have never trusted them. They are ill-treated by their upper-caste Hindu brothers, not by Muslims. We owe them nothing,” she wrote. Irena Akbar also called for boycotts of business establishments run by Hindus. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

46,04-Oct-23,"Uttar Pradesh: Farmer reaches police station to file FIR against goats in Kanpur, accuses them of stealing flowers","In a bizarre turn of events, a man in Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur reached a police station to file complaint against goats for stealing his flowers. A bizarre case has come to light in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur where a person named Shailendra Nishad reached a police station with a complaint against goats for stealing flowers. According to him, some goats entered his field and started eating the marigold blooms. He was able to catch two of them from the spot which he then put in an auto and drove to the cops. This has created a peculiar situation for the authorities who are now in an odd predicament and unsure of what course of action to take.The strange incident which transpired in the Gauri Kakra village of the Bhitargaon block has turned into a topic of discussion in the neighbourhood. Flowers are cultivated around here and the complainant who is a farmer by profession is also into Floriculture. He had been worried for quite some time because someone would secretly pluck them in the evening. He asked the people of his hamlet regarding the same but could not find any information. On 2nd October, he decided against going to the city to sell the flowers and sat down with a stick to guard his fields. Meanwhile, in the evening he discovered that four to five goats had invaded his land from one side and devoured the flowers. He became outraged and tried to capture the four-legged thieves. However, he was able to nab only two of them after which he went straight to the road, loaded them into the vehicle and arrived at the police station. The policemen were astounded to witness the man with the goats and shocked to learn the reason behind his visit. When the cops inquired about the purpose of bringing the livestock there, he responded, “Sir, they quietly gorge on my flowers every day due to which I am suffering a lot of financial loss. However, the owner of the goats does not pay any attention to them. Therefore, I caught these goats which steal and eat my flowers and brought them here.”The cops were perplexed about what to do after hearing his story, however, they later found out who the animals belonged to. Police Inspector Pramod Kumar informed that they are of a girl in the village. Someone had loosed them and they went into the fields, but now instruction has been given to keep them tied. Authorities have also warned that the animals should not enter the victim’s fields again. The matter was resolved and he has forgiven the goat owner and no First Information Report was submitted either. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

47,04-Oct-23,Anandotsav: How a new Bharatanatyam festival in Mumbai gave a sneak peek into the future of one of India’s ancient dance forms,"To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. On a drizzly Saturday evening (30 September), when the maximum city generally turns into one big ball of blinding disco lights, the new seeds of Bharat’s ancient art and culture were sprouting in one of the suburbs of Mumbai. Chimes of ghungroos echoing with every taalam (rhythm) reverberated through the alleys of Vile Parle.“Aanandotsav”, the first annual Bharatanatyam festival organised by Kalaadnya Dance Academy in partnership with Nrityankur, marked the arrival of a new generation of Bharatanatyam performers. Both Kalaadnya and Nrityankur are affiliated with the Akhil Bharatiya Gandharva Mahavidyalaya till Alankar Poorna (the final stage of Bharatanatyam training). Kalaadnya was founded in 2016 by Sayali Sutar, a Girnar Ratna awardee and Master in Bharatanatyam, who has performed across cities in and outside India. Sayali Sutar is a disciple of the great Vaibhav Arekar, founder of Sankhya Dance Company.The 163-seater auditorium of Sathye College was fully occupied by guests, friends and families of Devis, most of whom were delivering their debut performance. Gracing the occasion amongst the guests were Gautam Marathe, ace Bharatanatyam dancer and founder of Angika, and Pooja Pant, ace Kathak dancer and founder of Pooja Pant Dance Company.The show began with three young girls presenting their first piece called Todaimangalam, an invocation piece in praise of Shri Ganesha. The young performers were still just tracing their steps from the training but attempted to put their best foot forward aspiring to give a physical form to the Shlokas dedicated to Gajanana, Maa Saraswati, Mahalakshmi, and Bhagwan Shiva.The nervousness in the budding talent was evident even as their beautiful red costumes and vibrant shringar (make-up) enthralled the audience. This was the first time that many among the audience were witnessing their daughters perform Bharatanatyam, which many pursue as nothing more than an extra-curricular activity or a hobby but only a rare jewel makes it to the global stage.The show took the spectators through the journey of Bharatanatyam training. How yogic steps including sukshma vyayam (light exercises) are practised by Bharatanatyam dancers for muscle strengthening and toning to get the perfect posture were expressed with a tinge of humour in the performance called Natyobics.From hereon began the introduction to Bharatanatyam through Bharatanatyam. The youngest to the eldest dancers of Kalaadnya performed a piece called Adavumala, meaning a chain of basic movements of Bharatanatyam, choreographed by Sayali Sutar. The performance was followed by another piece called Alarippu, a flowering bud, which aptly describes the performers themselves.Vatsalya Padam, performed to the melodious bhajan ‘Krishna Ne Begane Baaro’ in Kannada language in Ragam Yamuna Kalyani and Talam Mishra Chapu, showed how Maa Yashoda is enchanted by the divinity of playing hide and seek with her son, Krishna, The Jagadguru. The blissful and wholesome choreography is credited to Vaibhav Arekar. It was performed by Kalaadnya student Mrunmayi Malpekar.The show then dives deeper into Bhakti, a state of divine trance if you will, with group performances to Achyutam Keshavam – a Hindi bhajan translated from the original Sanskrit rendition by Shri Adi Shankaracharya; Shri Ram Stuti, written by the supreme devotee of Bhagwan Ram, Goswami Tulsidas and choreographed by Sayali; and Kasturi Tilakam. Special mention goes to the sole boy dancer amongst a large group of girl dancers, like Krishna among Gopis.The Mallari performance was like a grand Ganesh Chaturthi celebration taking centre stage. It added a fun twist to this journey of performances dedicated to Devis and Devatas. The rendition conveyed India’s vibrant and magnificent religious processions when a temple deity is carried by an ocean of devotees out of His and Her humble abode on special occasions. Performed in Raga Nattai, Tala Aadi, this piece – performed by the terrific trio Srishti Ganesh, Pritha Bakshi, and Mrunmayi Malpekar – through Bharatanatyam, beautifully packaged the colours and excitement that Hindu religious processions bring to society.What came next was the show-stopper of the evening. From the music to the Bhakti in the performances listed above, there was a sense of familiarity. But the most intense aspect of Bharatanatyam revealed itself when Kalaadnya’s Srishti Ganesh performed Javali, a light classical love song with strokes of romantic gestures, something that the layman is used to witnessing only in movies most times. Such renditions are not easy to guage and understand unless the performer has used their expressions and mannerisms with precision. Srishti Ganesh achieved that beautifully. When she entered the stage, Srishti seemed to be on the backfoot owing to her light make-up, but from the very first to the last movement of her performance, Srishti had captured the attention of the spectators in its entirety. Her poetic mannerisms and the effortless ease with which she expressed a woman in love, being teased by and getting lost in the thoughts of her lover would make anyone want to fall in love.The order of the performances designed by the organisers deserves appreciation. The Jatiswaram performance, a purely Bharatanatyam recital sans abhinay, ensured that the flow of the show remained undisturbed as did the sentiments evoked by the previous performances.Instead of bringing the evening to a close, the festival concluded by welcoming Navratri and paying obeisance to Mahishasur Mardini and the ever-existing and all-knowing forms of Maha Shakti. The best part was the battle between Maa Durga and demon Mahishasur followed by the various forms of Devi Shakti.To be able to resonate with the common man, even when they may or may not understand the intricacies of an ancient dance and art form like Bharatanatyam, is an achievement in itself. That Kalaadnya’s Sayali and Nrityankur’s Arundhati through Anandotsav have taken it upon themselves to realise the aspirations of young and bright Bharatanatyam performers assures that the best of Indian culture is nowhere nearly lost and there’s surely more to come.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

48,27-Sep-23,When a Hindu King did a ‘Sardar Patel’ 575 years ago: How Gajapati Kapilendra Deva from Odisha liberated Telangana from Islamic rule,"Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories, and ultimately defeat the tyrant Sanjar Khan in modern-day Telangana region. A few days ago, we commemorated the Hyderabad Liberation Day, paying homage to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel’s strategic genius, which promptly put an end to the oppression of the Razakars under the Nizams, sparing the Hindu majority from further suffering. The well-coordinated and decisive action by the Indian Army dealt a crippling blow to the barbaric Razakars, who had subjected Hyderabad’s Hindus to unspeakable cruelty. This marked the realization of a long-cherished dream for the people of the region — freedom from the Nizam’s rule.Surprisingly, a strikingly similar historical parallel unfolded in the very same region nearly 575 years ago. During the reign of the formidable Bahmani Sultanate, ruled by Allaudin Ahmad Shah, almost the entire expanse of Telangana came under his dominion by 1448 CE. This conquest followed the expulsion of local Hindu chiefs who had held sway in the region for years.With most of Telangana under his control, Ahmad Shah appointed Sanjar Khan as the region’s governor. Khan proved to be a ruthless despot harbouring a profound hatred for the local Hindu population. He captured Hindus and forced them into servitude(Mukherjee Prabhat, The history of the Gajapati kings of Orissa, p.29), with women and children bearing the brunt of his brutality mostly. Throughout his rule, Hindus lived in perpetual fear of enslavement.Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Odisha, significant developments were underway. Under the leadership of Kapilendra Deva of the Suryavamsi Gajapati dynasty, a dynamic and forward-thinking ruler emerged. Unlike many of his contemporaries who adopted a defensive posture against Islamic kingdoms, Kapilendra Deva believed in taking the battle to enemy territories. Starting with a relatively modest domain comprising 5-6 districts surrounding his capital, Cuttack, in Odisha, he expanded his realm all the way to the Krishna River in modern-day Andhra Pradesh by 1448 CE. Along the way, he decisively defeated the Sultanate of Bengal and Malwa, annexing their territories.With his dominion bordering that of Bahmanis he was not unaware of what was happening in Telengana. Therefore, the clash with the Bahmanis was just a matter of time. Sultan Ahmad Shah was well aware of the formidable Gajapati army’s military might, often reputed to include an astounding 2 lakh elephants (Mohapatra R P, Military history of Orissa, p. 122). While this might seem like an exaggeration, the Odia army indeed boasted a considerable number of elephants, which earned their kings the moniker “Gajapatis.” Nevertheless, the Sultan advised the stubborn Sanjar Khan to avoid tangling with the “possessors of elephants,”(Indian Antiquary Vol. XXVIII P. 237) recognizing that he was no match for them. This counsel fell on deaf ears, and haughty Sanjar Khan engaged the Gajapati army in battle. The Gajapati army was well prepared and had eagerly awaited this opportunity to strike at the Bahmanis. The stage for a fierce confrontation was set in modern-day Khammam, Telangana. Leading this pivotal battle was Hamvira Deva, Kapilendra’s son, and it ultimately led to the slaying of the tyrant Sanjar Khan (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.49). Finally, the Hindus of the region could breathe a sigh of relief.This marked the beginning of a series of invasions by Kapilendra into the Bahmani Sultanate’s territory. He not only liberated the entire Telangana region from the Bahmanis but also captured Mahur Fort, located in the modern-day Nanded district, Maharashtra from them. Other important forts like Racakonda, Devarkonda, Warangal (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.54) and many more fell into his hand. Ultimately, the Gajapati army laid siege to Bidar, the capital of the Bahmani kingdom in modern Karnataka. Sanjar Khan’s brutal reign was met with a resolute response from the Hindu conqueror Kapilendra Deva, culminating in the capture of the Bahmani capital (Subrahmanyam R, The Suryavamsi Gajapatis of Orissa, p.58). This historical episode bears an uncanny resemblance to the events in newly independent India. In the same region, the Razakars perpetrated heinous atrocities against the Hindu populace, and we witnessed how Sardar Patel’s brilliance ensured their demise.Such historical events underscore the importance of leaders with a profound understanding of prevailing geopolitical circumstances and an unwavering commitment to Hindu interests. However, it is essential to remember that such responses require meticulous long-term planning and years of preparation. Our history stands as a testament to our ability to execute such strategies successfully, both in the past and potentially in the future. Unfortunately, the significant achievements of this great king who at one point ruled along the east coast from the Hooghly River of West Bengal in the north to Rameswaram in Tamil Nadu in the south, have not been much explored by earlier scholars due to various reasons. This author has tried to put those in the form of a book titled “Gajapati Kapilendra Deva, The history of the greatest Hindu conqueror of 15th Century India”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

49,25-Sep-23,"Canada: Parliament speaker apologises for celebrating a Nazi who killed Jews during WWII, Trudeau’s govt faces another humiliation","""Canada's Jewish community stands firmly with #Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. But we can't stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed"", the CIJA had shared on the Parliament's celebration of a Nazi criminal. On 24th September, Canadian Parliament speaker Anthony Rota apologised for celebrating a Nazi, Yaroslav Hunka, who had participated in the genocide against Jews during World War II. In his statement, Rota claimed that he was made aware of more information on Hunka that “caused” him to regret the decision to celebrate him. Furthermore, he claimed no one in the Parliament or among the Ukrainian delegation was aware of his intentions to celebrate Hunka during his address.On September 22, in the House of Commons, I recognized an individual in the gallery. I regret my decision to do so, and accept full responsibility for my actions. Read my statement here: https://t.co/Hd9chtHFNJHe said, “On Friday, 22nd September, in my remarks following the address of the President of Ukraine, I recognised an individual in the gallery. I have subsequently become aware of more information, which causes me to regret my decision to do so. I wish to make clear that no one, including fellow parliamentarians and the Ukraine delegation, was aware of my intention or of my remarks before I delivered them. This initiative was entirely my own, the individual in question being from my riding and having been brought to my attention. I particularly want to extend my deepest apologies to Jewish communities in Canada and around the world. I accept full responsibility for my actions.”Earlier, the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs expressed their concerns over the matter. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), they said, “We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. Canada’s Jewish community stands firmly with #Ukraine in its war against Russian aggression. But we can’t stay silent when crimes committed by Ukrainians during the Holocaust are whitewashed.”We are deeply troubled & disturbed that a Ukrainian veteran of the infamous 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the Nazi SS – which actively participated in the genocide of Jews – was celebrated with a standing ovation in the Canadian Parliament. #Canada's Jewish community stands…Pierre Poilievre, leader of the Official Opposition since 2022, has also raised objections to celebrating Hunka in the Parliament. He pointed out that Trudeau personally met and honoured Hunka. Accusing the ruling party of recognising a Nazi veteran on the floor of the House of Commons, he demanded an apology from the PM.It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division).Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognized on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the… https://t.co/9JFUEqsdW8He said, “It has come out today that Justin Trudeau personally met with and honoured a veteran of the 14th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (a Nazi division). Liberals then arranged for this Nazi veteran to be recognised on the floor of the House of Commons during the visit of the Ukrainian President. This is an appalling error in judgment on the part of Justin Trudeau, whose personal protocol office is responsible for arranging and vetting all guests and programming for state visits of this kind. No parliamentarians (other than Justin Trudeau) had the opportunity to vet this individual’s past before he was introduced and honoured on the floor of the House of Commons. Without warning or context, it was impossible for any parliamentarian in the room (other than Mr Trudeau) to know of this dark past. Mr. Trudeau must personally apologise and avoid passing the blame to others as he always does.”On 22nd September, the Canadian House of Commons gave a standing ovation to Yaroslav Hunka, a World War II veteran who fought for “Ukrainian independence” against Russian aggressors. This is how the speaker of the House, Anthony Rota, introduced him. The 98-year-old war veteran, however, was a member of a SS unit, the 14th SS-Volunteer Division “Galicia”, established in 1943 by the Nazis. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was also present during the occasion. Notably, SS was the main paramilitary group under Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in Nazi Germany and was primarily responsible for tunning Holocaust operations. 14th SS-Volunteer Division Galicia was made up of volunteers, which means that Yaroslav Hunka joined the unit on his own will, and was not conscripted.The members of the First Ukrainian Division have been deemed war criminals by several experts. However, Canadian inquiry into their history did not recognise them as war criminals. Interestingly, there is clear evidence that Canada housed at least 3,000 war criminals. Canadian authorities established a commission to look into war criminals, and the commission headed by Justice Jules Deschenes submitted its report in December 1986 titled “Commission of Inquiry on War Crimes“. As per the report, the Canadian government had allowed over 2,000 war criminals from WWII to enter Canada despite the Canadian Jewish Congress’s opposition. The commission gave Hunko’s division “clean chit” due to the lack of evidence. 2014 Nazi Hunter Steve Rambam called Canada a safe haven for war criminals. Notably, the Indian Ministry of External Affairs also called out Canada in a recent statement for giving shelter to terrorists and gangsters.

50,11-Oct-23,"Maharashtra: Gaurakshaks in Pune save cows, Iqbal Alam and two other smugglers arrested; cow meat seized from a vehicle in Manchar","During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. On Tuesday (10th October) Gorakshaks in Pune saved two cows from the clutches of cow smugglers who were taking the cows to a slaughterhouse in Pune. Iqbal Alam and other two smugglers were arrested in this case based on the complaint filed by Gorakshak Upendra Balkavde. In another incident in the Pune district, cow meat was seized from a car in Manchar on 9th October.Upendra Mahadev Balkawade, 32, works with the Hyundai Company in Pune. He has also been working as the Pune district president of the All India Krishi Go Seva Sangh for the last two years. Upendra Balkavde said in his complaint, “On 09/10/2023, around 09:30 pm, I received a call from my Gaurakshak colleague. He told me that two cows were being taken to Kondhwa Pune for slaughter in Motor Tempo Vehicle No. MH 12 QW 5747 from Rajaram Bridge Pune. Accordingly, my Gaurakshak colleagues Suraj Suresh Bandal, Ganesh Dattatray Sutar, Manish Mahadev Chavan and I sat in a motor car No. MH 12 OT 1400 at Dandekar Bridge and stopped on the road leading to Swargate.”He further stated, “On 09/10/2023 at around 11:45 pm, we saw the motor tempo heading towards Saaras Bagh and immediately we followed him in our car. We warned the tempo driver to stop. But the driver did not stop his vehicle and went ahead from Savarkar Chowk, Mitra Mandal Chowk. Laxmi Narayan Chowk, and Diasplot Chowk.”Upendra Balkavde added in his complaint, “Since the driver was not stopping his tempo, I stopped my car in front of his vehicle at Golden Bakery Diasplot Gultekdi Pune around 00:05 pm. We all got out of our car and inspected the tempo. The rear of the tempo was covered with green tarpaulin sheets. When the tarpaulin sheet was removed, we discovered two live cows, one white and one black-and-white. I called the police control room and called the police to the spot. When the police arrived, the police and I took the tempo and came to Swargate police station, Pune.”The three arrested accused are identified as Iqbal Alam (age 22, resident of Ghorpadi village in Pune), Rahim Ismail Shaikh (age 32), and Deepak Lallan Singh Thakur (age 30). During interrogation, Rahim Shaikh said that the cows were brought from Sanjay Pawar who lives in Pandit Jawahar Lal Colony at Canal Road behind Dasbhuja Ganapati Mandir on Karve Road in Pune. A case in this regard is registered in Swargate police station under sections 5 and 9(A) of the Maharashtra Animal Protection Act 1976, and sections 11(1)D, 11(1)E, and 11(1)I of Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960. The Gaurakshaks and police took the cows to a local Jain Hindu Gaushala in Pune.A copy of this FIR is with OpIndia. OpIndia contacted Upendra Balkavde to learn more about the incident. He said, “We Gaurakshaks have an active network in and around Pune city. The accused in this case are arrested by police and will face legal consequences. We do our best using whatever capacities we have. The smugglers were taking the cows to Kondhwa. The Kondhwa area in Pune has become a hiding hub of Islamic terrorists. Recently, the NIA took action and nabbed a few such people who used to live there. Slaughterhouses are also in the same Kondhwa area.”Upendra Balkavde added, “Sanjay Pawar mentioned in this case supplies cows to these smugglers. We have caught him in two similar cases before this incident. He is a repeat offender. Most of the cow smugglers take cows to the Mumbai area. However, in and around Pune city, our group works hard to prevent cow slaughter and save Gaumata and Dharma.”Underlining the importance of coordinated efforts of all the Gaurakshaks, Upendra Balkavde said, “No mission is difficult when the community comes together to put a joint effort. Ours is not a very large group, but coordinated work gives effective output. In this operation, Sahil Pawar, Ganesh Sutar, Manish Chavan, Chetan Badole, Datta Pawar, Tanmay Babar, Sahil Kamble, Aniket Dalvi, Sachin Gaikwad, Suraj Bandal, Siddhesh Shigwan, and Shivam Sonawane played a crucial role. They were with me throughout the incident and took various responsibilities in this task to save the cows.”The incident came to light in the early hours of 9th October when beef weighing 405 kg was found in a four-wheeler that met with an accident on Pune Nashik Highway Road at Bhorwadi under Manchar police station limits. A case has been registered against the unidentified absconding driver and unidentified owner of the car. At approximately 3:50 am on 9th October, an unknown individual, driving a Ritz car with the registration MH06AZ7781, was travelling at a high speed on the Pune-Nashik Highway. This vehicle collided with the pickup truck, bearing the license plate MH14KQ7339, which was owned by Akshay Shankar Thorat, a resident of Manchar Pimpalgaon in the Ambegaon taluka, from behind.Partially cut organs and flesh of cattle weighing 405 kg worth Rs 81,000 were found in the car. The driver of the car escaped from the spot. A case has been registered against the driver and owner of the car under sections 279 and 427 of the Indian Penal Code, sections 184,134 (A)( B), and 177 of the Motor Vehicle Act, Sections 5, 5(c), and 9(a) of Maharashtra Animal Protection Amendment Act 1995, and section 11 of Indian Animal Protection Act.Police Sub-Inspector Shete is conducting a further investigation into this case under the supervision of Police Inspector Balwant Mandge. It is notable that Balwant Mandge is the same police officer who upheld the peace talks and restrained people from filing any case in a recent incident of a Hindu-Muslim scuffle during the Ganpati Visarjan procession in Manchar. A day after this incident, Islamists in Manchar attacked the house of a Bajrang Dal activist Suraj Chakradhar Dharam. When the members of Bajrang Dal and Vishwa Hindu Parishad insisted that a case should be filed in this regard, the attackers apologised to Suraj Dharam and his family members with folded hands.

51,09-Oct-23,"Blood, Islam, and oil: The Saud family’s history of bloody battles with Ottomans, desert warlords, and partnership with the USA to become a global power","After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title 'King of Najd and Hejaz'. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).On 9th September 2023, a groundbreaking agreement was unveiled during the G20 Summit in New Delhi with the announcement of a rail and shipping corridor from India to Europe via the Middle East. The project – ‘India-Middle East-Europe Shipping and Railway Connectivity Corridor’ (IMEE EC) is being hailed as the new spice route in the new world order. As part of the IMEE EC project, ‘moderate’ Saudi Arabia and ‘Jewish-majority’ Israel have come closer than ever to normalise their diplomatic ties. Reportedly, Saudi Arabia is engaged in negotiations with the United States to sign a defense pact in exchange for establishing diplomatic relations with Israel, a nation that was considered a pariah in the Islamic world. However, reports suggest that Saudi Arabia will not obstruct a deal even if Israel does not grant significant concessions to the Palestinians in their quest for statehood. Apparently, these changing geopolitical happenings are being attributed as one of the motives behind the recent terrorist attacks by Hamas on Israel. Although the Hamas-initiated attacks could derail or delay the deal, back-channel diplomacy continues to bridge gaps and bring the Saudi-US deal closer to finalisation. Against this backdrop, the Middle Eastern region is potentially at the cusp of marking an end to the dominance of Wahhabi ideology which was deeply rooted in a puritanical interpretation of Islam, in the Middle East and its spheres of influence.  Remarkably, the Wahhabi ideology has exerted its dominance and molded the course of events across the Middle East for the better part of three centuries. It also played a pivotal role in the formation of the modern Middle East, notably Saudi Arabia as it stands today, and the consolidation of power by the Al Saud, the ruling monarchy of Saudi Arabia. The power dynamics in the region are an outcome of alliances both matrimonial (blood pact), religious pacts, and regional partnerships that were born out of inter-imperial battles between the Ottoman and British Empires.    In the 18th century, Muhammad ibn Saud from the Al Saud (Al being referred to as family) was a Chieftan of a small oasis town of Diriyah on the outskirts of modern-day Riyadh. During his reign, an Islamic fundamentalist theologian, Sheikh Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab sought refuge in Diriyah as he was thrown out of Hejaz, the region that housed both the holy sites of Islam – Mecca and Medina. Wahhab’s extremist interpretation of Islam had irked the Hashmites who had been Sharifs of these holy sites for several centuries. These Sharifs who hailed from the Hashmites tribe of Hejaz owed allegiance to the Ottoman Empire. The Islamic Empire had limited or nominal direct interest in the affairs of the Middle Eastern region primarily because of the lack of resources in the Middle East in general, the Najd region in particular, and its unfavorable desert climate. However, it maintained a significant interest in the religious pilgrimage routes and at the holy sites of Islam.Meanwhile, Chieftan Mohd ibn Saud not only gave refuge to Wahhab but also signed a pact with him in 1744 marking the beginning of the First Saudi state. Under the pact which is often dubbed as “Wahhabi-Saudi Pact”, Mohd ibn Saud remained as the Emir while Wahhab assumed the title of ‘Imam’. To strengthen the pact, Ibn Saud’s eldest son married al-Wahhab’s daughter. Al Saud publicly embraced Wahhabism. As a theologian, Wahhab also went on to lay the foundation of “Wahhabism” in the region. The aim of this pact was to bring purity to the faith and establish a puritanical form of Islam. Soon, Wahhabism became the official Saudi religious doctrine. Under this extreme form, religious innovation (bidaa) was vehemently rejected and it advocated for eliminating practices such as Sufi rites and veneration of saints. During their conquest outside Najd, they destroyed shrines of the Shia minority. The Wahabis used the slur ‘Rafida’ (rejecters) to refer to Shia, which still continues in the 21st century. On the other hand, the Emir of Diryiah Mohd ibn Saud started expanding control over various tribal regions in Najd (the central part of current-day Saudi Arabia) and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. He had gained religious certification from Imam Abdul Wahhab. Subsequently, brainwashed ‘Wahhabist’ tribes like Ikhwan joined his religious conquest of the Arabian Peninsula, under the Al Saud banner.The Emir also formed alliances with tribal leaders and groups in Najd, including the Ajman and Otaiba tribes. These alliances were mostly based on a mix of military cooperation and shared religious ideals, particularly Wahhabi Islam.However, the battle of consolidation included fierce battles against the rival Al Rashid (Rashidi family) and the Hashemite Sharif of Mecca, who had support from Egypt, the vassalage of the Ottoman Empire. In 1765, the Emir of Diriyah, Muhammad bin Saud passed away but by then the Wahhabis had controlled Najd and expanded in all directions, including Mecca and Medina. He was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud Al Saud as the new Emir of Diriyah.The period between 1811-1818 saw battles which are also known as the Egyptian-Wahhabi War as it was fought by the Egyptian representative of Ottoman and Wahhabists from Diriyah under the Al Saud banner. During the religiously zealous conquest, when the Egyptian subjects of Ottomans attempted to invade al-Hasa’ which lies in eastern Arabia, the Wahhabis seized the holy city of Karbala’ in Turkish Iraq (1801). It was followed by capturing Mecca itself in 1802. By the year 1805, the Wahhabis controlled Mecca and Medina. They had also attacked Karbala and the Imam Husayn Shrine which directly challenged the Ottoman Empire and their vassalage, Egyptians and Hashmite Sharifs of Mecca. Furthermore, under the leadership of Emir Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud, the Wahhabis targeted Ottoman trade routes, badly impacting the finances of the Ottoman Empire. The Emir of Diryiah also openly denounced and questioned the Ottoman Sultan Mustafa IV, challenging his legitimacy as the Caliph and protectorate of the faithful and holy sites in Hejaz.Following that, in 1811, the Ottoman Sultan Mahmoud II ordered Muhammad Ali Pasha, who was considered the Wāli in Egypt, to check the expansionist spree of the Emir of Diryiah. Ali then assigned his son, Tusun Pasha, to lead a force of 10,000 soldiers. However, in 1812, the Emir of Diriyah, Abdullah defeated Tusun Pasha at Al-Safra. But with a reinforcement of 10,000 men, Pasha recaptured Mecca and Medina. On account of poor health, Tusun tried to forge a treaty with the Emir in which Hejaz was to be surrendered & vassalage offered. However, neither Ali nor the Sultan ratified the treaty with the House of Saud. In 1816 Tusun Pasha died and with mutual distrust abound, the war resumed with Ali’s other son, Ibrahim Pasha assumed leadership and led an expedition, driving the Saudi Emir and his “Wahhabis” (more properly Salafis) into the desert of Najd.Subsequently, in 1818 Ibrahim marched across the desert and brought his forces to the gates of Diriyah. They ruthlessly massacred the male population of the rebel force. Diriyah was razed to the ground and all Wahhabi theologians found were executed. The captured Emir of Diriyah Abdullah bin Muhammad bin Saud was brought to Istanbul where he was publicly beheaded and his head was thrown into the Bosphorus. Additionally, the Wahhabis were compelled to listen to music, an act strictly prohibited in Wahhabism.This marked the ending of the first Saudi state (1744-1818) which had begun with the Saudi-Wahhabi pact. Two years after causing disruption in Najd, Ottoman forces withdrew from the region. Over the ensuing eighty years, the Al Saud made several attempts to regain control of the Arabian Peninsula, but their efforts failed courtesy of the Ottoman-Al Rashidi alliance. Son of Former Emir of Diriyah, Turki bin Abdullah bin Muhammad Al Saud and a few others had managed to escape the Ottoman carnage and soon after the Ottoman’s withdrawal, they started to regain their lost territories.  By 1824, the Al-Saud family had regained political control of central Arabia. With Diryiah in ruins, the Saudi ruler Turki bin Abdullah Al-Saud transferred his capital to Riyadh which was some 20 miles south of Diriyah. With this, he established the Second Saudi State. In his 11 years of reign, Turki recaptured most of the lands lost to the Ottoman Empire. The Second Saudi State, under the leadership of Turki and his son Faisal, came to an end when the Al-Rashid family of Hail, with the backing of the Ottomans, successfully overthrew the Saudi State. This occurred during the Ottoman Empire’s renewed campaign in 1865 to expand its influence in the Middle East. Ottoman armies had captured parts of the Saudi State, which was ruled at the time by Faisal’s son, Abdulrahman. After repeated defeats by a much larger and better-equipped army, Abdulrahman bin Faisal Al-Saud abandoned the struggle in 1891 marking the end of the Second Saudi state. During the exile, he sought refuge with the Bedouin tribes in the vast sand desert of eastern Arabia known as the Rub’ Al-Khali, or ‘Empty Quarter.’ From there, Abdulrahman and his family traveled to Kuwait, where they stayed until 1902. His young son Abdulaziz became the head of secular and military matters while he was in exile. Over the course of time, he launched raids and terrorised the tribes loyal to the Al Rashidis with an aim to regain Al Saud territories from Rashidis, the vassalage of Ottomans. On 15th January 1902, Abdulaziz, a direct descendent of Muhammad ibn Saud, accompanied by only 40 followers – mostly his blood relatives, half-brothers, cousins, and Kingsmen launched a daring night mission. They scaled the walls of Riyadh’s citadel to capture the city garrison, known as the Masmak Fortress. The Rashidi governor and his loyal man were slaughtered in cold blood. Reviving the emirate of Najd, with Abdulaziz as Emir and Abdul Rahman as Imam, this raid marked the beginning of the establishment of the third Saudi estate which continues to this present day and is known as the modern Saudi state.Meanwhile, during World War 1 (1914-1919), the Al Saud aligned with the British Empire against their common foe, the Ottoman Turks, and their Arabian allies. He signed the Treaty of Darin with the British in 1915 which recognised his authority over much of Najd and established a formal alliance.Around the same time, Britishers lured Hejaz into its own orbit and pulled it away from the Ottomans which later proved to be a great betrayal for the Hashimites. Evidently, during the ‘Arab Revolt’ (1916-1918), the Hejaz area (Mecca and Medina) broke free from the Ottomans. This was led by Shareef Hussein, the founder of the Hashemite dynasty and he declared himself king of the Arab countries as well as later, the new Caliph. However, in reality, he was only the king of Hejaz. Hussein was originally the Sharif of Mecca. In the present-day context, the descendants of Hashemite dynasties are now the monarchs of Jordan. Notably, the British and French had an agreement called the Sykes-Picot Agreement to divide some territories of the Middle East. Palestine, Jordan, and Iraq were actually controlled by the British. At the same time, Syria was controlled by the French. After capturing Riyadh, Al Saud wanted to expand further and consolidate the tribal areas once and for all. Apart from allying with Britishers, Abdulaziz also allied with the fierce nomadic warrior tribe of Bedouins, Ikhwan, or Muslim brothers. The Ikhwan had been brainwashed in Wahhabi ideology during the reign of Abdulaziz’s forefathers. Together they crushed all rebels including Ottoman’s effort to intervene. They captured Mecca in 1924 and Medina in 1925 which were ruled by Hashimites who had been pulled away from Ottomans by the British, yet British ally Al Saud ended 700 years of rule of Hashmities as Sharif of the Holy cities of Islam (barring a few years in between).   Consequently, Abdulaziz became the ruler of the Two Holy Cities of Islam. However, afterward, Al Saud crushed Ikhwan in 1929, their Muslim warriors as they had an uncontrollable urge to spread Wahhabism beyond Arabia despite Abd al-Aziz imposing restrictions on them. The Ikhwan had started considering them corrupt due to their enormous wealth and Western allies. After conquering Hejaz in 1925, Al Saud officially incorporated the title ‘King of Najd and Hejaz’. In 1932, the two merged together to give birth to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia – named after Abdulaziz’s family (Al Saud).In order to forge unity in his newly established kingdom, Abd al-Aziz entered into marital alliances by marrying daughters from every powerful tribe in the region and influential clerical families, he had around twenty wives, however, not more than four wives at a time, in accordance with Quranic principles. With these unions, he had 45 legitimate sons and an undisclosed number of daughters (with daughters typically not being counted). His half-brothers and cousins assisted him in conquering the peninsula. However, he started consolidating power in favor of his own sons. Since then, every Saudi king has been a son of Abd al-Aziz ibn Saud with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman aka MBS is his only grandson who has risen to power. Despite having an alliance with the British, Saudi Arabia was wary of its imperial ambitions, and moving forward it found an ally in the United States. Consequently, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. established diplomatic relations. Subsequently, in 1933, the initial foreign oil explorers made their way to the kingdom. The Americans, in a significant transaction, paid $170,000 in gold for land concessions that, as it turned out, held the world’s largest oil reserves. Despite facing criticism that the invitation of foreigners into the kingdom contradicted Islamic principles and citing precedent from the Quran, King Abd al-Aziz extended an invitation to U.S. oil companies to help develop Saudi Arabia’s oil resources. Collaboratively, the oil companies and the Saudi government established a joint venture, which later evolved into the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco), with shareholders that included America’s four largest oil corporations.While the kingdom maintained a stance of neutrality during World War II, it leaned towards the Allies. Towards the war’s conclusion, King Abd al-Aziz held meetings with both UK Prime Minister Winston Churchill and US President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR). In 1945, despite health concerns for both leaders, King Abd al-Aziz and FDR met for three days aboard the U.S.S. Quincy, which was docked in the Suez Canal. The Quincy Agreement laid the groundwork for Saudi-American cooperation in matters related to oil and defense. Additionally, the two leaders solidified a confidential pact: King Abd al-Aziz pledged to grant the US secure access to Saudi oil, while in return, the US committed to providing military assistance, training, and the construction of the Dhahran military base in Saudi Arabia.Since then, barring a few instances of power struggles within the Royal family, the House of Saud has been a stable power in the Middle East and the country leading the oil powers in the region. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

52,09-Oct-23,"As Hamas attack on Israel triggers a war in Middle East, here is all you need to know about Hamas and the Gaza Strip","Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting
official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank.On 7th October (Saturday), Israel came under one of the worst attacks in recent history after dozens of Hamas terrorists infiltrated the Israeli territory from the Gaza Strip. Additionally, Palestinian terrorists also launched massive rocket barrages at southern and central Israel from the Gaza Strip prompting it to declare a ‘state of war’. The terrorists also held several Israelis hostage including women, children, and the elderly. They have killed several civilians in indiscriminate firing and videos of the incident doing rounds on the internet reveal that they had also paraded women bared and bruised on the streets of Israeli towns.Following the terrorist attack on Israel, Palestinian Islamic Movement, Hamas claimed responsibility for these attacks. In a rare public statement, the leader of the military wing of Hamas, Mohammed Deif announced that it has launched a new military operation against Israel. Mohammed Deif added that 5,000 rockets had been fired into Israel early Saturday to begin “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” and provoked all Palestinians to fight. It is important to note that Deif’s provocation was delivered in a recording as he has been in hiding after surviving multiple assassination attempts.On its part, Israeli forces have started retaliation and are fighting to regain control of areas captured by the Hamas terrorists. Amidst this, here is a brief overview of everything about this outfit1 Hamas, including its genesis, its supporters, and how it draws funds to attack Israel. Hamas is an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, which means “Islamic Resistance Movement” in English. It was founded by Sheikh Ahmed Yassin who was a Palestinian cleric. After doing Islamic scholarship in Cairo, he was associated with the local branches of the Muslim Brotherhood. In the 1960s, Yassin preached religious sermons in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Subsequently, in December 1987, Yassin established Hamas as the political arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in Gaza. This came in the backdrop of the first intifada – Palestinian attacks against Israel for alleged atrocities in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem. Initially, Hamas believed that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) was a threat to the Muslim Brotherhood so it did everything to ‘counter’ it. In 1988, Hamas published its charter which called for the destruction of Israel and the establishment of an Islamic society in historic Palestine. Since April 1993, Hamas has been carrying out suicide bombings. The first reported bombing was done five months before PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed the Oslo Accords. The historic accord led to the establishment of limited self-government for parts of the West Bank and Gaza. A new entity called the Palestinian Authority (PA) was created for this purpose. However, Hamas condemned and tried to derail these developments towards peace. It also condemned the PLO’s and Israel’s recognition of each other.Later, in 1997, the United States designated Hamas a foreign terrorist organisation as it went on to spearhead violent resistance during the second intifada, in the early 2000s. Hamas’s founder, Yassin was killed by Israeli forces in 2004.Apart from the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO), Hamas is the other major outfit in Palestinian territories. Since 2006, the Islamist outfit Hamas has controlled the Gaza Strip. Back then, it defeated its rival political party, Fatah, in elections but after that, there hasn’t been any election in the Palestinian enclave.It is notable that the Palestine state is divided into two territories, the Werst Bank on the east of Israel, and the Gaza Strip on the west. While Hamas governs Gaza, the governance of the West Bank, the much larger territory bordering Jordan and the Dead Sea apart from Israel, is complicated. While the West Bank is generally under the occupation is Israel, there are a large number of Palestinian enclaves that are under total or partial control of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).While anti-Israel sentiments prevail in the entire Palestinian state, this sentiment is strongest in the Gaza Strip, which is under Hamas rule.Gaza Strip is a 41km-long and 6-12 km-wide territory between Israel, Egypt, and the Mediterranean Sea. It has one of the highest population densities in the world with a population of about 2.3 million people. Israel exercises control over the airspace above Gaza and its coastline, regulating the entry and exit of people and goods through its border crossings. Likewise, Egypt governs the passage of individuals into and out of Gaza through its border. According to the UN, almost 80% of the Gazans depend on international aid, and about one million people rely on daily food aid. However, it is often reported that millions of foreign aid and funds from like-minded countries were funneled to anti-Israel activities including terror attacks. In fact, Hamas which is ‘governing’ the Gaza Strip is notorious for launching attacks, and suicide bombings on Israel. Notably, dozens of nations, including Israel, the United States, and the European Union as a bloc, have classified Hamas as a terrorist organisation, particularly its military wing, due to its involvement in suicide bombings and acts of terror directed against Israel.Hamas has several bodies that perform various political, military, and social functions. There is an overarching consultative body referred to as the politburo. It operates in exile and sees the ‘General policy’ of the outfit. The grassroots issues in Gaza and the West Bank are seen by the local committees of Hamas. Since June 2021, Gaza’s de facto prime minister is Issam al-Da’alis.Whereas, Ismail Haniyeh is the political head after he replaced longtime leader Khaled Meshaal in 2017. Since 2020, he along with other Hamas leadership has been operating from Doha in Qatar because Egypt limited his movement into and out of Gaza. Previously, Syria used to host Hamas leadership, but it had a fallout with Syrian authorities after the Palestinian refugees participated in the 2011 uprising that preceded the Syrian Civil War. Meanwhile, some of the Hamas leadership has an office in Turkey and they reportedly operate from there.Meanwhile, Yahya Sinwar who served twenty-two years in an Israeli prison for masterminding the abduction and killing of two Israeli soldiers sees ‘day-to-day’ affairs in Gaza. He was released from prison along with more than one thousand Palestinian prisoners in 2011 in exchange for an Israeli soldier held by Hamas terrorists.Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, is commanded by Marwan Issa and Mohammed Deif. It is important to note that the responsibility for recent terrorist attacks on Israel was taken by Deif stating that Hamas has carried out ‘Operation Al-aqsa storm’.   The founder of Hamas military wing, Salah Shehadeh was assassinated by the Israeli forces in a 2002 air strike. Hamas operates from Lebanon which is reportedly headed by Saleh al-Arouri. He also took over Hamas’ West Bank leadership after internal elections in 2021. Hamas maintains close ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon.Hamas is a designated terrorist entity and for this reason, it is barred from getting official assistance that the United States and European Union (EU) provide to the PLO in the West Bank. Apart from funding from Palestinian expatriates, private donors in the Persian Gulf, and Islamic charities in the West, Hamas reportedly gets financial and other support from Iran, Turkey, and Qatar among other Islamic nations.   Iran is one of the biggest benefactors of Hamas as it contributes funds, weapons, and training to fight a proxy war against Israel. Iran pumps funds to the tune of $100 million annually to Hamas, PIJ, and other Palestinian outfits designated as terrorist organisations by the United States.However, during the Syrian civil war, Iran and Hamas had a brief fallout with each other.Qatar also provides hundreds of millions of dollars in assistance to Gaza through Hamas. However, foreign aid generally reaches Gaza via the PA and UN agencies. Earlier, Hamas amassed funds to the tune of $12 million per month from taxes on Egyptian goods imported or smuggled into Gaza through tunnels. Gaza shares a 12 km long border with Egypt on its south. However, in 2013, Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi assumed power. Since then, Cairo has ended Hamas’s operation as it asserts that Hamas is an extension of the Muslim Brotherhood. Afterwards, the Egyptian military closed down the majority of tunnels that were crossing into its territory. This action took place during their campaign against a faction affiliated with the self-declared Islamic State on their side of the border, within the Sinai Peninsula. Additionally, Turkey is another backer of the Hamas particularly after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rose to power in 2002. Though it claims that it backs Hamas only politically, Ankara has been accused of funding Hamas’s terrorism, including through aid diverted from the Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency.Hamas has been in control of Gaza since Israel’s withdrawal from the territory in 2005. In the subsequent year, Hamas got a majority of seats in the PA’s legislative body and established a government. It is claimed that Palestinians believed that Fatah’s leadership had become corrupt during its tenure within the PLO and had achieved limited progress in Palestinian-Israeli negotiations which resulted in Hamas getting the majority, after which it has never conducted an election. Since 2006, Palestinians have not voted for a legislature, nor for a president since 2008.However, Fatah rejected the outcome of the elections and the party ousted Hamas from power in the West Bank. While in Gaza, Hamas hunted down Fatah’s militias to extend its authoritative control.  In theory, Hamas follows the Sharia-based Palestinian Basic Law, as does the PA. However, Hamas is notorious for implementing an extreme version of Sharia, including controlling how women dress and enforcing gender segregation in public during the early years of its rule. It has repressed media, civilian activism on social media, the political opposition, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) in Gaza who argue that more focus should be diverted towards the welfare of Gazans than launching terror attacks on Israel.Hamas has been firing a spree of rockets and mortars into Israel after it took over Gaza. Iranian security officials admitted that Tehran provided some of these weapons. However, after getting training from Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and proxies, Hamas has been building its own missiles as well. Additionally, Hamas has been dropping hundreds of balloons laden with inflammatory substances and explosives, along with rockets on Israeli territories causing indiscriminate death and destruction to civilians. Israel has responded fiercely and unsparingly against the continued provocation, with persistent airstrikes and tank fires on locations described by it as Gaza’s military infrastructure installations.Hamas has also launched incursions into Israeli territory, and it is responsible for numerous terrorist attacks including the recent one which is still ongoing. One of the most infamous incidents occurred in 2006 when they kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit. In exchange for Shalit’s release, Israel released more than a thousand Palestinian prisoners, including Sinwar. Additionally, in 2014, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of abducting and killing three Israeli teenagers in the West Bank.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

53,08-Oct-23,"‘My son is not a criminal’, says the mother of Nilesh Parmar who was arrested after Vadodara incident where Islamists pelted stones on Ganesh Visarjan Yatra","Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar.During the Ganpati Visarjan procession at Manjusar in Vadodara, a Muslim mob pelted stones at Hindu procession. Many people were injured in the attack and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also damaged. Both parties lodged complaints with the police after the stone pelting. During their operation, the police detained a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker from Savli, Nilesh Parmar, and later sent him to Ahmedabad Central Jail under the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act (PASA). Hindu organisations and locals opposed the action, calling it unfair. In the meantime, OpIndia contacted Nilesh Parmar’s family and tried to know their side.Nilesh Parmar, an RSS volunteer, hails from the village of Gothada in Savli taluka. This village predominantly consists of Muslim residents, with the village sarpanch also being of the Muslim faith. We spoke to his mother, Madhuben Thakorbhai Parmar. Throughout our discussion, Madhuben’s voice exhibited a sense of distress, clearly affected by the recent turn of events involving her son. Throughout our interaction, Madhuben consistently asserted that Nilesh was entirely innocent. She claimed that Nilesh was present at a different location on the day of the incident in question. She said that Nilesh had actually gone out to attend a social gathering.When OpIndia spoke to Nilesh’s mother Madhuben, she said at the very beginning of the conversation that her 26-year-old son was not guilty in any way. He is an RSS volunteer and always raises his voice for the country, religion and society leading from the front. Madhuben said, “Our village is Muslim majority and the sarpanch is also a Muslim. There are frequent clashes between Hindus and Muslims in the village and taluka. In such a situation, Nilesh has become a known face among Hindus due to his service work at a young age. Seeing this, the local political leaders started feeling jealous. That’s why he is often being targeted in this way.”Nilesh’s mother further said, “This is not the first time that my son’s name has been linked to a crime without any reason. Even before this, Nilesh’s name has been wrongly linked in various complaints many times. His name is not mentioned in the primary complaint, then later his name is added to the statements of the accused due to political pressure.”When we talked about the incident in Manjusar, she said, “Sangeetaben Sanjaybhai Parmar of our family died on the same day and at the same time as the incident in Manjusar. So our entire family, including Nilesh, was engaged in a post-death ritual here. Nilesh was not present at the spot where the commotion took place. His name has been wrongly added to the statement by the police under political pressure.”While talking further, Madhuben became emotional remembering her son. She told OpIndia that her son was falsely implicated. She demanded justice for her son. We asked her about her son’s affiliation with RSS. She said, “My son was involved with RSS since childhood, is now in RSS and will continue to be so. While working in the RSS, he has been doing many service works for the local people which he is proud of.”OpIndia also spoke to Nilesh’s cousin Kewal Parmar. He also said that his brother had been falsely implicated. Kewal said, “Earlier in 2021, Nilesh had organised a street march of RSS in Gothada village. Even then, it was opposed by the local Muslims and the Muslim sarpanch who said that the RSS yatra should not be taken out in our village. At that time too, Nilesh was harassed a lot.”Kewal further said, “Nilesh was gradually becoming popular among the local Hindu community and Hindu youths for his service work. In a Muslim-dominated area like Savli, he expanded the scope of the RSS work. Due to this, there were many attempts to implicate him in a false case repeatedly.”Finally, he said that no matter what happens, he will not give up and will continue to fight on every judicial path to get justice for his brother Nilesh Parmar.Earlier, OpIndia had also spoken to the local Savli police station about the incident. The local police confirmed the arrest of Nilesh Parmar. At the same time, PSI Anirudh Kamaliya clarified, “An investigation is currently underway to find out whether Nilesh Parmar was involved in the Manjusar incident. However, Nilesh Parmar has been sent to Sabarmati jail under PASA after his name cropped up in complaints against both sides and his name cropped up in more than three similar offences.”On Thursday (28th September), there was an incident of stone pelting during Ganesh Visarjan at Manjusar in Savli taluka of Vadodara. In this incident, some Hindus were injured and the idol of Lord Ganesha was also broken. In this case, the police have registered an FIR against 18 people and the mob of the remaining 30 unidentified people and further investigation is underway. On the other hand, it has been learned through reports that 5 accused of stone-pelting have also been arrested.वडोदरा के मुंजसर मैं गणेश विसर्जन पर कल किए गए पथराव की तस्वीरें आयी सामने.पथराव करने वाले फ़िलहाल गाँव छोड़कर भाग निकले.पुलिस ने फ़िलहाल पाँच लोगो को पकड़ा है बाक़ियो को ढूँढा जा रहा है. https://t.co/y7GpjqiOup pic.twitter.com/GHJFnblQCpThe incident took place in Manjusar village of Savli. Videos of this incident have also surfaced on social media. In these videos, it is seen that miscreants wearing face masks threw stones from the roofs of the houses. Islamic posters were also put up in the building from where the stones were thrown. It is learnt that the stone pelters are currently absconding and efforts are on to trace them.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Reacting to the fatal stab attack at a high school in Arras, French President Emmanuel Macron said that the country has been hit by the “barbarity of Islamist terrorism”, The New York Times reported on Saturday.The incident occurred in Arras in northern France on Saturday, where a school teacher was killed and two students were left injured in a stabbing incident at Gambetta-Carnot public school. The police quickly set up a security perimeter around the school, and the city announced that it was suspending all public events until further notice, The New York Times reported.Speaking to reporters, here in Arras, Macron said, “France had been “hit by the barbarity of Islamist terrorism.” “Almost three years to the day after Samuel Paty’s murder, terrorism has struck again in a school,” President Macron said after rushing to the scene.He further said that the victim was killed in a “brutal and cowardly way”.

55,14-Oct-23,"Amid Israel-Hamas war, Modi govt evacuates second batch of 235 Indians from Tel Aviv under ‘Operation Ajay’","As many as 447 Indian nationals, who were stranded amid the raging Israel-Hamas war have been brought back to India under 'Operation Ajay'.A second flight carrying 235 Indian nationals from Tel Aviv in Israel, under Operation Ajay, landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport in New Delhi on Saturday morning.The evacuated Indian nationals were welcomed by Union Minister of State (MoS) for External Affairs, Rajkumar Ranjan Singh, at the airport.

56,14-Oct-23,Iranian embassy in Spain denies reports that Cristiano Ronaldo was convicted of ‘adultery’ and sentenced to 99 lashes in Iran for hugging a disabled woman,"While in Iran, Ronaldo presented painter Fatemeh Hamami with a signed jersey. He embraced her and planted a kiss on her cheek, expressing his appreciation for her gifting him two of her artworks crafted with her feet.Iranian embassy in Spain has denied reports that ace footballer Cristiano Ronaldo could face 99 lashes the next time he visits Iran after his picture hugging an Iranian painter went viral on the internet.Taking to X (formerly Twitter), Iran’s embassy in Spain posted, “We strongly deny the issuance of any court ruling against any international athlete in Iran. It is a matter of concern that the publication of such unfounded news could overshadow crimes against humanity and war crimes against the oppressed Palestinian nation.”Desmentimos rotundamente la emisión de cualquier fallo judicial contra cualquier deportista internacional en Irán. Es motivo de preocupación que la publicación de noticias tan infundadas pueda eclipsar los crímenes de lesa humanidad y los crímenes de guerra contra la oprimida… pic.twitter.com/51xw40L7GpThey further added, “It should be noted that Cristiano Ronaldo travelled to Iran on September 18 and 19 to play in an official soccer match and was very well received by the people and the authorities. His sincere and humane meeting with Fatemeh Hamami was also praised and admired by both the people and the country’s sports authorities.”The 38-year-old Portuguese Al-Nassr star, romantically linked with Georgina Rodriguez, hugged the Iranian painter recently during his visit to Tehran. It was during his trip to Iran in September for a match against Persepolis in the Asian Champions League, a game that CR7’s side emerged victorious from with a 2-0 score.While in Iran, the soccer player presented painter Fatemeh Hamami with a signed jersey. He embraced her and planted a kiss on her cheek, expressing his appreciation for her gifting him two of her artworks crafted with her feet.As per the Iranian press, multiple Iranian lawyers have lodged accusations against Cristiano Ronaldo for this conduct. Iran has strict laws for what it considers ‘adultery’ and in accordance with Iranian law, physical contact with an unmarried woman is considered akin to adultery. Reportedly, the Iranian judiciary could have imposed a sentence of 99 lashes on Cristiano Ronaldo during his future visits to Iran. However, a judge can pardon the sentence if the actions are deemed non-punishable or if those involved express remorse.Currently, the possibility of Ronaldo returning to Iran seems limited, given that Al Nassr has no immediate plans to play there.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

57,13-Oct-23,"Iranian Ambassador to India Iraj Elahi claims Iran played no role in Hamas terror attack on Israel, says “Hamas an independent player”","Iran played no role in the recent developments. It was the inevitable and foreseeable response of the Palestinians to the continuous oppression by the apartheid regime, Iraj Elahi saidResponding to an email questionnaire sent by ANI on the recent Israel-Hamas war that has engulfed the Middle East region, the Iranian Ambassador to India, Iraj Elahi, distanced his country from Hamas’ recent attack on South Israeli communities along the border with Gaza. The full transcript of the email questionnaire is as follows:ANI Question: What do you think about recent developments in Israel?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: What surprises me the most is that we still rarely see an accurate representation of what really happens in Palestine. Israel commits countless atrocities against innocent Palestinians in Gaza, yet a significant portion of the media continues to overlook the Palestinians. Instead, they choose to concoct new evidence against Hamas to justify the criminal actions of the occupiers and the siege of Gaza. The Zionists act as if Palestinians are not human, suggesting that no one should care about their ceaseless suffering. This behavior illustrates the sheer brutality Palestinians endure. Regrettably, their voices and demands continue to be overshadowed in the media. No one dares to question why they should be deprived of basic human necessities like water, power, medicine, and other essential needs. The vast majority of the media deliberately ignores the truth, turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the voices and faces of Palestinians whose only “fault” is being born in Palestine.ANI: There are reports by Western media that Iran helped plot attack on Israel over several weeks? Your comment on that.Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Western media tries to deny the independent power of Hamas by attributing recent developments to Iran’s support. However, in truth, the strength of Hamas stands as an undeniable fact, and it remains an independent player that can steer the course of events on its own. As the Supreme Leader has stated, Hamas executed this operation without the assistance of Iran. Nonetheless, Iran will always support the Palestinian cause and the legitimate resistance of the Palestinians, consistently condemning the ruthless violence and occupation by the Zionists.ANI: Iranian President and Saudi Crown Prince discussed the Palestinian-Israeli conflict on Wednesday, in the first telephone call between the two leaders since a China-brokered deal between Tehran and Riyadh to resume ties. If you can talk about the discussions?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Iran and Saudi Arabia, like other Muslim countries, have already announced their staunch support for Palestine cause. However, they decided to engage in dialogue to better understand each other’s viewpoints and assessments regarding recent developments, with the aim of reaching a more common understanding. During the conversation, both sides emphasized the necessity of ending hostilities against innocent people and the crucial need for unity within the Muslim world in opposition to the criminal acts of Apartheid regime.ANI: Iran is known to be one of Hamas’s biggest benefactors, contributing funds, weapons, and training. What will you say on that?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: The Palestinians have independently embraced the path of truth, and they have become an inspiration for everyone resisting oppression. We admire the Palestinians; our hearts are with them and we support their legitimate resistance against the apartheid regime.ANI: What about the peace in the West Asia region and Middle East region? We have seen massive changes there. Like Abraham accords. Do you think that all is going to square 1 and this will have a fallout on the whole of the region and the world?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: Zionist extremism is the primary cause of instability in the region. As long as the basic rights of Palestinians are denied, no external solution can achieve stability. In other words, any plan that doesn’t address the root causes of the conflict is destined to fail. The wounds of Palestine continue to bleed, affecting the entirety of West Asia. I believe that stability is unattainable without recognizing the rights of Palestinians. External solutions proposed by outsiders may only destabilize the region and worsen the overall situation.ANI: UK Foreign Secretary and USA Foreign Secretary are in Israel. President Biden said that his administration has warned Iran not to escalate the conflict between Tehran’s proxy Hamas and Israel. your comment?Iraj Elahi-Iranian Ambassador to India: As we said Iran played no role in the recent developments. It was the inevitable and foreseeable response of the Palestinians to the continuous oppression by the apartheid regime. Western media tries to attribute this to external factors, especially Iran, to hide the role of Zionist regime as the primary cause of the conflict. Furthermore, the US and its allies are deeply concerned about the emergence of new conflict fronts, as they recognize the vulnerabilities of the Zionist regime.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

58,13-Oct-23,"Traders committee urges Karnataka govt to allow Muslim vendors on temple premises, files complaint against Mangaladevi Temple in Mangaluru","The Mangaladevi temple management said that there was no restriction on Muslim vendors, adding that no non-Hindu trader participated in the auction for shopsAhead of the Hindu festival of Navratri, the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi Districts Religious Fair Businessmen’s Coordination Committee has demanded that Muslim vendors be allowed to carry out trade on the temple premises during the festive days even as the temple authorities have restricted them from doing so.The committee members had filed a complaint with the District Commissioner of Dakshina Kannada over the boycott of Muslim vendors during the Navaratri celebrations at the renowned Mangaladevi Temple in Mangaluru, Dakshina Kannada district. The honorary presidents of the committee DK Imthiyaz and Sunil Kumar Bajal have claimed that Muslim vendors were excluded during the auction process undertaken to allot shops in the temple premises. Contrary to the Imthiyaz and Bajal’s claims, the temple management said that there was no restriction on Muslim vendors adding that the auction process for 94 shops in the temple courtyard was open for all, however, no non-Hindu trader participated in the auction. The temple management said that the auction process was conducted in accordance with the guidelines laid by the District Collector.It is worth noting that the Mangaladevi Temple comes under the state government’s Muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) department. Every year, a Navratri fair is organised at this temple dedicated to Goddess Shakti. This time the fair will take place between October 15 and October 24.The temple management had decided not to allow Muslim traders to participate in the fair and had begun the process of allocating stalls to businessmen on Rathabeedi Street, which is owned by the Mangaluru City Corporation. However, the temple administration has been holding its fairs here for many years.It is pertinent to note that Around 34,563 temples in the state are classified as Muzrai (Hindu religious endowment) grade A, B, or C depending on their revenue generation.In all, a total of 207 temples with yearly revenue exceeding Rs 25 lakh fall into category A, 139 temples with annual revenue between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh fall into category B, and 34,217 temples with annual revenue less than Rs 5 lakh go into category C. This categorisation was introduced by the Congress government in 2019.Last year, a controversy had erupted over the issue of not allowing non-Hindu particularly Muslim traders to put up stalls near Hindu temples. The demand for the same was raised by Hindu rights organisations including Bajrang Dal.According to the Hindu rights organisation, Rule 12 of the Karnataka Hindu Religious Institutions and Charitable Endowments Act, 2002, is intended to prohibit non-Hindu traders. The law states that “No property, including land, building or sites situated near the premises shall be leased to non-Hindus.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

59,13-Oct-23,Did a Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire while burning the Israeli flag? Know the truth behind the video which has gone viral,"The video is an old one from 2021 and the incident happened during the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran in May that year.The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has resulted in mass genocide, killing over 1300 Israelis and injuring hundreds more. As the Israel-Hamas war rages, a video went viral which showed a man unintentionally lighting himself on fire while burning an Israeli flag.The video has been widely shared on X since yesterday (October 12), with most of the users alleging that it was a Hamas supporter who attempted to burn the Israeli flag amid the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. They mocked the Hamas supporter saying that Karma paid him back. An X user @Hariindic shared the video with the caption, “Look at the current situation of Hamas – Hamas supporter accidentally set himself on fire! Karma works wonders.”#Hamas situation right now😂🇮🇱🇵🇸 WATCH: Hamas supporter accidentally sets himself on fire! Karma acts in wonderful ways.#Israel #IsraelPalestineWar #HamasMassacre #GazaUnderAttack #HamasTerrorism #Gaza_under_attack #HamasTerrorists #Palestine #GazaUnderAttack #Gaza pic.twitter.com/4pNnGgG6CbIn the footage, a man is seen holding a massive Israeli flag. Another man approached the man who was holding the flag and set it on fire. Within seconds, due to the direction of the wind, the clothes of the man who is holding the flag also catch fire. The man immediately drops the flag on the ground and scampers away after his clothes catch fire. Amusingly, the group of protestors who were seen standing beside him holding Palestinian flags, instead of coming to his rescue, quickly moved away from him to save themselves from the fire.Though the video was being shared extensively on X, formally Twitter, OpIndia decided to do some investigation, after which we learned that the video was an old one that resurfaced in the midst of the recent Israel-Hamas confrontation. Even in 2021, the same video was shared by numerous social media accounts. The majority of these accounts belonged to Muslim people who had posted the video to express their hostility towards Israelis.خداوندا مارا از دست پیروانت نجات بده.God, save us from your followers pic.twitter.com/T3xGT5ImJyIn fact, the Times of Israel reported about the incident in May 2021. The media report shared the same video posted by several X users then, claiming that the video was from the Al-Quds Day protest that was carried out in Iran on May 7 2021.Let us inform you that in 1979, the year of the Islamic Revolution, Iran established Al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day. The Iranian government marks the day with anti-Israel rallies, demonstrations, and threats to “liberate” Jerusalem from Israeli rule.In conclusion, despite the fact that the video has recently gone viral amid the ongoing Israel and Hamas war, it is an old one from Iran and does not feature any Hamas supporters or terrorists. Though here too, the Israeli flag was burnt in a show of sympathy for Palestine and a show of anger against Israel.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Furthermore, he forced her to abort the baby after she became pregnant and pressured her to convert to Islam. Now, the authorities have registered a First Information Report on the complaint of the girl and started an investigation. She has charged that the accused who is a resident of Ujariyaon village exploited her under the guise of marriage. The matter pertains to Gomti Nagar. The two initially met at Janeshwar Mishra Park during a stroll after which he befriended her, trapped her into a romantic bond and gradually gained her trust. His family was aware of their love affair. He regularly established a sexual relationship with her throughout this time in his house and multiple hotels on different occasions and recorded it on video. Meanwhile, she got pregnant and he began pushing her to have an abortion against her will. The girl wanted to keep the child, but he threatened and assaulted her to fulfil his demand. The perpetrator pacified her by promising marriage after she warned him to complain to the cops but even after a significant amount of time had elapsed he did not keep his word and she filed a report after which he absconded to Dubai last June. She charged that his family members were compelling her to embrace Islam and thrashed her after she protested.He also continued to push her to do the same and threatened to make her clips viral on Facebook and Instagram and defame her through social media. The police have lodged a First Information Report against a total of eight people including seven named and one unknown in connection with the abortion and religious conversion. (Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police) ADCP Syed Ali Abbas stated that police have submitted an FIR and are trying to capture the culprit. He assured that police teams had been formed and he would be apprehended soon.She was reportedly compulsed to undergo an Ultrasound by the offender and his sister-in-law to confirm the pregnancy after which they had the fetus terminated. She objected to their plan and was battered by them. The girl did not want to become a Muslim which was unacceptable to him and his relatives who threatened to post the private footage online. She revealed that their names are Imran Khan and Ishaan including a few others who are presently in Bahrain. They are also sending obscene videos on her mobile. She recently arrived at Afzal Siddiqui’s residence to demonstrate against their immoral actions but was beaten up severely by his family.

Marouf said, “We urge our citizens not to engage in these attempts”.Responding to Hamas asking civilians to remain in north Gaza despite warning to leave within 24 hours, IDF said, “Hamas is telling Gaza residents to ignore our safety instructions.” The official X handle of IDF said, “The IDF is calling for the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City from their homes southward for their own safety and protection.”The IDF is calling for the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City from their homes southward for their own safety and protection.

IDF is asking civilians to leave Gaza City before launching a ground invasion. IDF has said that Hamas terrorists hiding in tunnels below houses and in buildings with civilians.The leaflets dropped by IDF said, ‘Don’t return to your homes until further notice from the Israel Defence Forces. Leave all public and known shelters in the city of Gaza. Do not approach from the security wall, and whoever does so, is risking their lives.’ Around 1.1 million people live in north Gaza, mostly Gaza City, who have been told to evacuate to south.Talking about the upcoming ground attack on Hamas in Gaza, a spokesman for the Israel Defence Forces said that “the scenes out of Gaza will be hard to stomach” when the attack is launched.Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus, the international spokesman for the Israel Defense Forces, added that “the going gets ugly when Israel attacks Hamas in Gaza, in the second phase of the attack after the bombing of Hamas sites in Gaza Strip for the last 6 days.Earlier in the day, IDF issued a public notice on its X (Twitter) handle, calling for the evacuation of all civilians from Gaza City to the south of Wadi Gaza, a small stream that divides Gaza into two parts and flows in the Meditation Sea.

62,13-Oct-23,Karnataka: Rs 42 crores in cash recovered from contractor Ambikapathy who alleged 40 per cent commission against previous BJP govt,"As per reports, it is believed that the cash was intended for transportation to neighbouring Telangana; however, an official statement on this matter is yet to be released. The amount, in Rs 500 denominations, was stashed in 23 cardboard boxes at the residence of a former corporator from Ward 95.Late last night in Bengaluru, a sum exceeding ₹42 crore in cash was discovered concealed in 23 boxes beneath a bed. This substantial amount was unearthed during Income Tax raids on R Ambikapathy, who had alleged a 40 per cent commission against the previous government in Karnataka. As per reports, it is believed that the cash was intended for transportation to neighbouring Telangana; however, an official statement on this matter is yet to be released. The amount, in Rs 500 denominations, was stashed in 23 cardboard boxes at the residence of a former corporator from Ward 95.The contractor supposedly tried to stonewall the raid and attempted to stall the handover of keys to the flat where the money was discovered, coinciding with a suspected effort to relocate the funds, a report published in The Hindu said. It’s noteworthy to mention that Mr. Ambikapathy gained prominence during a campaign led by the Karnataka Contractors’ Association. The campaign had accused the previous BJP regime of charging a ’40 per cent commission’ for State Government contracts. Additionally, he was among the contractors apprehended in a criminal defamation case filed against them by former minister Munirathna over corruption accusations but was subsequently released.Accusing the Congress government in the state, BJP leader and former deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan claimed that the funds were amassed from contractors as a commission to finance the upcoming elections in five states.“This substantiates the allegations of an ‘ATM government’ (against the Congress government) with supporting evidence… What has been apprehended is a fraction of the funds amassed by the ‘ATM government.’ There are numerous similar instances. The seized money is a portion of the accumulated funds. Consider this as a representative example,” he remarked, encouraging other contractors to come forward and disclose the money they purportedly handed over.Dismissing the accusations as “baseless”, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah stated, “The allegations are without merit. No state (within the Congress) has requested (for money). We haven’t provided any either… Have you witnessed it? Have the (BJP members making the accusations) witnessed the transfer of funds to other states? There’s no basis for such misleading claims.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

According to reports, a sizable police presence was stationed in the nation’s capital’s streets to maintain surveillance during the Friday prayers. Security was also heightened in sensitive areas, including around the Israeli Embassy; Jewish synagogues and other Jewish establishments.In the Jama Masjid area, the Delhi police conducted a flag march to ensure public safety.Further, state authorities in Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh and Goa have been asked to ensure security for Israeli diplomats, staff and tourists.The development came after Hamas urged Muslims across the world to observe Friday Namaz as ‘day of rage’ and ‘day of jihad’ against Israel. Following the call for terrorism by Hamas, Israel warned its citizens worldwide to take extra care as pro-Palestine and anti-semitic protests have been staged in several cities around the world.In the aftermath of the calls by Hamas, an Israeli diplomat was stabbed in Beijing on Friday (13th October). According to a statement reportedly by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, the staffer is receiving medical treatment at a hospital and is stable.A purported video of the attack went viral on the internet. The video showed the attacker, dressed in a white shirt, armed with what appears to be a long knife. The video showed the attacker stabbing the diplomat at least 5 times aiming at his throat and coming repeatedly at him while the diplomat tried to fight the attacker off.The sidewalk – where the Israeli victim is seen struggling to save himself – is full of blood as passersby watch in horror.

64,13-Oct-23,"Bangladesh: Hindus attacked in Comilla during protest march against MP Bahauddin Bahar, who demonised Durga Puja as ‘festival of alcohol’","The demonstration came under attack from Islamists belonging to the 'Chhatra League' and 'Jubo League', both affiliated with the ruling Awami League.A protest march organised by the Hindu community came under attack in the Nazrul Avenue area in ​​the Comilla metropolis of Bangladesh. The incident took place on Friday (13th October) at 11 a.m.In a video posted on YouTube by Global Television, members of the Hindu community could be seen running for cover. As per reports, a total of 5 people, including one woman, were injured during the attack. One of them also sustained severe injuries to his head. Three of the victims were identified as Aditya Das, Sunil Das and Tanmoy Das.The said demonstration was led by the Bangladesh Youth Unity Council, Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council (HBCUC), Student Unity Council and Women Unity Council against the disturbing remarks made by an Awami League MP (Comilla-6 constituency) named Bahauddin Bahar about Durga Puja.According to Rana Das Gupta, the General Secretary of the Hindu Buddhist Christian Unity Council, Bahauddin had demonised the annual Hindu Bengali festival as ‘Madjukto Puja‘ (festival of alcohol) on 4th October this year. The Awami League MP also claimed that if alcohol consumption was decreased, then, the number of Puja pandals would go down. On Thursday (12th October), he yet again associated ‘Durga Puja with alcohol’.Just last month (28th September), Munshiganj district Mayor Faisal Biplab referred to Hindu MP, Mrinal Kanti Das, as ‘malaun’ (a derogatory term for Hindus), ‘nopungshak’ (impotent) and ‘chandal’ (a derogatory term for Dalits). Miffed by the vicious targeting of the Hindu festivals, the members of the community took out a protest march and demanded action against the Awami League MP. However, the demonstration reportedly came under attack from Islamists belonging to the ‘Chhatra League’ and ‘Jubo League’.While ‘Chhatra League’ is the student wing of the Sheikh Hasina-led-Bangladesh Awami League, ‘Jubo League’ is the youth wing of the same party. Bahauddin Bahar, who made the contentious remarks about Durga Puja, is also an MP of Awami League.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

65,13-Oct-23,"“Fetus has no separate identity from mother”: Justice BV Nagarathna says a woman cannot be forced to undergo pregnancy, CJI says “even an unborn child has rights”","CJI DY Chandrachud, who presided over the three-judge bench, directed ASG Aishwarya Bhati to persuade the woman to ensure her baby was born healthyOn Thursday, 12th October, a Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud told a 27-year-old married woman who filed a petition to abort her 26-week fetus, that she should reconsider her decision saying that “even an unborn child had rights.”CJI DY Chandrachud, who presided over the three-judge bench, directed ASG Aishwarya Bhati to persuade the woman to ensure her baby was born healthy. The bench also stated unequivocally that it would not request that doctors stop the foetal heartbeat,’ stressing that “we cannot kill the child.”This comes after a split order was passed by a Supreme Court bench comprising Justices Hima Kohli and BV Nagarathna on Wednesday. The woman’s appeal was initially accepted by the two-judge bench. The next day, however, the Union of India filed an application to recall the ruling, citing an email from an All India Institute of Medical Sciences doctor claiming that the foetus was healthy and had a good chance of survival.Taking the email into consideration, Justice Kohli recalled the earlier ruling, stating that her “judicial conscience does not permit the petitioner to terminate the pregnancy.” However, Justice Kolhi did not approve of the conduct of the doctor who sent the email, who is a member of the medical board that initially backed medical abortion.The Supreme Court judge stated that because the petitioner is unwilling to continue the pregnancy, whether the foetus is viable or not is “irrelevant”.“The pregnant lady is not interested in continuing with the pregnancy. In such a case, whether the child to be born is viable or if the infant will be healthy is irrelevant. What is to be focused upon is, whether or not the pregnant lady intends to give birth to a child,” Justice Nagarathna said.Justice Nagarathna went on to assert that a “fetus has no individual personality from the mother” since it is dependent on the mother for “its very existence.”“It would be incongruous to conclude that the foetus has a separate identity from the mother and in spite of the physical or mental health of a mother being under threat, she will have to continue her pregnancy until the foetus is born which would endanger her delicate health. Such a position is contrary to Article 21 and 15(3) of the Constitution of India which recognize the right to life and liberty and particularly those of a woman,” Justice Nagarathna said.The three-judge bench, led by the CJI, expressed reluctance to allow the petitioner to end the pregnancy due to the viability of the foetus. During the hearing, CJI Chandrachud stated that the rights of the unborn child are just as essential as the decisional autonomy of the woman. The hearing was adjourned until today to provide the petitioner time to consider.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

If anyone attempts to spread malicious content, prompt and severe action should be taken against them,"" the government spokesperson, privy to the meeting, said.On Thursday, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath warned those spreading hate over the Israel-Palestine conflict, asserting that supporters of Hamas will not be spared. He firmly instructed state officials to deal with individuals attempting to incite hatred and provoke unrest concerning the Palestine matter amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict in West Asia.In a law and order review meeting held at his Lucknow residence, the UP CM made it clear that any actions conflicting with the stance of the Government of India regarding this matter would not be tolerated, as reported by an official.“The chief minister mandated that regardless of the platform—be it social media or any place of worship—no divisive statements should be made by anyone. If anyone attempts to spread malicious content, prompt and severe action should be taken against them,” the government spokesperson, privy to the meeting, said.Adityanath additionally instructed the police and administrative heads of each district to engage with local religious leaders and convey this message to them.The instructions from the Chief Minister follow closely after four students from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) in the state were charged for reportedly organizing a demonstration in support of Palestine on the campus. Various political figures lodged complaints with the police, expressing their opposition to the pro-Palestine march on the university grounds. In response, AMU stated that they had initiated an internal investigation into the incident.Since the previous Saturday, Hamas-led targeted assaults on Israeli civilians have resulted in the loss of 1,300 lives on the Israeli side, including deaths of babies, toddlers, and infants, some of whom have been brutally beheaded and burnt alive.

67,13-Oct-23,"Ladakh Congress working president justifies Hamas atrocities on innocent Israelis, tries to falsely project ‘Palestinian Mujahideens’ as victims","Umpteen visuals are available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery that Hamas has inflicted on Israeli civilians.Along the lines of his higher-ups in Delhi, Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress has declared his unwavering support for the Palestinians and their terrorist organisation Hamas, which has been committing horrific atrocities and war crimes against Israel since it launched an unprecedented attack on the nation on October 7. ‘Hamas Mujahideen from Gaza have started to take back their land from America’s pet Israel, killed and kidnapped Israeli soldiers. They have shown Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai’: Congress Working President, Ladakh pic.twitter.com/9oBM9Dr4YgThe Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas has been inflicting unspeakable violent crimes on Israeli civilians, including brutal murders, the beheading of children, rape, kidnap and taking hostage, yet the Congress leader, in a video shared by Times Now, is heard hailing the Hamas terrorists and justifying the atrocities they have been committing.He can be heard applauding the ‘Hamas Mujahideen’ from Gaza for carrying out attacks against Israel, which he refers to as the slave of the ‘biggest devils’- the United States of America. The Congress leader further lauded the Palestinians for conquering back their land which he claimed they lost to the Israelis.The Congress leader proudly admitted that Hamas terrorists have killed and kidnapped several Israeli soldiers while justifying the atrocities that Hamas perpetrated against Israel and its defence forces as well as its innocent citizens. He exulted that the Palestinian mujahideen had shown to the world that they would never submit to the Israelis despite all the constraints, sanctions, and repression.Further gushing over the war Hamas has declared against Israel, he said that the Palestinians have proven that “Israel ke wajood ki koi haisiyat nahi hai. Woh makde ke jaale see bhi kamjor hai, yeh unhone 7 October ko dikhla diya” (the existence of Israel is worthless. It is weaker than a spider’s web. This the Palestinians proved on October 7), he said.Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of the Ladakh Congress, continued to blatantly lie projecting Israelis as the aggressors and the Palestinians as the victims despite the fact that Israel only launched counterattacks on Gaza as retaliation to the devastation and mass destruction Hamas terrorists caused in Israel. He claimed that the Israeli soldiers killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and massacred their babies. Though it is true that many civilians from both sides have fallen prey to the war that was started by the Hamas terrorists on October 7, there are umpteen videos and images available on the internet that depict the extent of brutality and savagery members of the Islamists terror organisation Hamas have inflicted on Israeli civilians and defence personnel in these last 5 days. The numerous distressing visuals that have surfaced on social media, in fact, serve as evidence that Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli people, including women, the elderly, and newborns, by shooting, stabbing, beheading, and even burning them alive. In fact, on Thursday, October 12, the Prime Minister’s Office in Israel took the extraordinary step of releasing gruesome photos of murdered babies to reporters and the public, seeking to underscore the atrocities carried out by Hamas in its savage rampage through southern Israel on Saturday. OpIndia also listed 15 such videos showing how Hamas targeted innocent civilians and inflicted brutalities in Israel.The views of Asgar Ali Karbalai, the working executive president of Ladakh Congress, were in tandem with his party supremos who had also expressed sympathy for Palestinians. A resolution passed on October 9, by the Congress Working Committee (CWC) voiced concern over the situation and urged for a ceasefire. The resolution however backed the Palestinian people’s rights.The Congress party’s official statement emphasised the process of “dialogue and negotiations” to resolve the problem between Israel and Palestine.India's Congress party comes in support of Palestine after a key meeting https://t.co/5XqyfamvVH“The Indian National Congress has always believed that the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people for a life of self-respect, equality, and dignity must be fulfilled only through a process of dialogue and negotiations while ensuring the legitimate national security interests of the Israeli people.

68,13-Oct-23,Politics of prisoners heats up in Tamil Nadu: Muslim groups demand the release of 36 Muslim prisoners after AIADMK sought the release of Coimbatore blast convicts,"CM Stalin questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners, while BJP has opposed the demandPolitics have heated up in Tamil Nadu over the demand to release Muslim prisoners from jail, including those convicted in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast. Opposition parties including AIADMK, which recently exited NDA, are demanding the release of Muslim prisoners who have served a long time in jail. BJP is opposing the demand, while DMK is questioning AIADMK’s sudden love for Muslim prisoners. DMK is also trying to take a secular stand here, saying there the govt will not see prisoners based on their religion.The matter was raised in Tamil Nadu on Tuesday when a motion was raised seeking the release of the 36 Muslim prisoners. Almost all opposition parties in the assembly supported the motion, except BJP. Raising the matter in assembly, AIADMK leader Edappadi K Palaniswami urged the state to release them. He cited their health conditions and added that they have been in prison for more than 20 years. Palaniswami said that several political parties had been demanding the release of these prisoners and the state government should heed their plea.Several other MLAs from different parties made similar demands. Responding to the same, CM MK Stalin said that the government has already taken steps to release prisoners. He said that the state government had set up a six-member committee, led by retired Madras High Court judge, Justice N Authinathan, in December 2021 to look into the matter.The panel had recommended the release of 224 prisoners, following which the state decided to first release 49 prisoners, of which 20 were Muslim. The chief minister said the documents on the release were pending with Governor RN Ravi for his assent.Stalin also questioned AIADMK for their sudden demand for the release of Muslim prisoners. “While in power you didn’t take any steps to release Muslim prisoners. You blindly supported CAA and NRC. We and the minority community clearly know why AIADMK is showing such affection towards Muslim prisoners now”, said the CM.On the other hand, BJP has objected to the demand. State BJP chief K Annamalai has cautioned the state government against the premature release of the terrorists serving life imprisonment in the 1998 Coimbatore bomb blast case. Annamalai said he believed that terrorism shouldn’t be confined to a religion or community.In February 1998, a bomb blast by Radical Islamic Fundamentalists in a serene city like Coimbatore led to the loss of 58 lives and injured over 200.The SC last week stuck down the bail application filed by a few convicts in this case & reiterated it as an atrocious act. Despite…Annamalai wrote on X that he hoped good sense would prevail and Chief Minister M K Stalin would stop “his misadventure of releasing the radical Islamic fundamentalists” from prison.Apart from political parties, other organisations also have joined the demand. Several Muslim organisations held a protest in Chennai on Wednesday, 11 October, demanding the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving jail terms on terror charges. The protest was led by the Manithaneya Jananayaga Katchi (MJK), and it was organised outside the Triplicane mosque in Chennai, India Today reported.Muslim Organisations held protests in Chennai for the release of 36 Muslim prisoners serving life imprisonment for more than 20 years.#ReporterDiary (@PramodMadhav6) pic.twitter.com/Zi7TM9UpltThe Protestors also burnt the image of CM MK Stalin and raised slogans against the government. Later all the protesters were detained by the Chennai police.General Secretary of Manidhaneya Jananayaka Katchi, Taminun Ansari said “We held a protest today in Chennai demanding prisoners who served more than 20 years in Tamil Nadu prison should be released. We also thank the political parties who support our demand. We are shocked that the CM said in the Assembly that they have sent this to the Governor where already 22 bills are pending. We are going to siege the assembly now.”“Rape convicts in Bilkis Bano case were prematurely released by the Gujarat government. They have no moral rights to speak about this”, Thameemul Ansari said justifying the demand.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

Israel’s Foreign Ministry had expressed “deep disappointment” with China’s statements concerning Hamas’s assault on Israel.The deputy director for Asia and the Pacific at the Foreign Ministry, Ambassador Rafi Harpaz said that the messages from China have “no clear and unambiguous condemnation of the terrible attack and heinous massacre committed by the terrorist organisation Hamas against innocent civilians and the abduction of dozens of them to Gaza”.It was only after the Israeli ambassador called on Beijing to engage in talks around the conflict that China made its first public contact with Israel. Even as China has said it was “saddened” by the Israeli casualties, it has failed to condemn Hamas.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

72,13-Oct-23,Promoters of the Mahadev Betting app had links with Dawood Ibrahim’s D-company: Enforcement Directorate ,"The money employed in the scam was transferred to Middle Eastern nations, notably Dubai, through at least 500 hawala operators and almost 70 shell firms.The D-company, the criminal organisation created and run by one of India’s most wanted terrorists and accused of the 1993 Mumbai bomb blasts Dawood Ibrahim made agreements with the promoters of the Mahadev online betting application, Enforcement Directorate which is presently investigating the case, revealed recently. As per a report in Times Now, the promoters were in contact with Dawood Ibrahim’s brother Mustaqeem Ali Kaskar about developing an identical betting site for Pakistan where Dawood Ibrahim is reportedly hiding in Karachi. The agency is expected to charge Sourabh Chandrakar, one of the promoters of the app for crimes relating to terrorism based on these grounds. Following the success of the Mahadev betting app, Mustaqeem Ali Kaskar reportedly reached out to Sourabh Chandrakar in order to ask him to set up a similar betting platform for Pakistan that would deal in the country’s rupees. He also received about thirty bodyguards from the former during his visit to Dubai. The money employed in the scam was transferred to Middle Eastern nations, notably Dubai, through at least 500 hawala operators and almost 70 shell firms.Investigations by the ED have uncovered that the key figures behind the Mahadev betting app case, Sourabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal, joined forces with Dawood Ibrahim's brother to create a similar betting platform for Pakistan.@AruneelS | @RakeshKTrivedi pic.twitter.com/bcuKqD11gCMany senior politicians, government officials, entertainers, and businesspersons have reportedly been involved in the Mahadev betting app scam, the report stated. According to the agency sources, the app’s promoters have been using a vast network of Hawala operators and more than 70 shell companies to launder money to Middle Eastern nations like Dubai while operating out of Pakistan and expanding their company into Thailand.Sahara, Sharada, Rose Valley, and other Ponzi schemes are accused of robbing depositors of their hard-earned money many of whom committed suicide, but there was no national security component. It was an antiquated technique for defrauding individuals by promising them greater returns while trapping them in a debt trap. However, as the investigation into the Mahadev betting app moves forward, a ton of vital information, proof and particulars have come to light that might blow the cover off a potential financial plot against India, the report stated.At least 138 online gambling apps with ties to China and other questionable foreign jurisdictions were prohibited by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in an order issued in February. Lotus 365 and other betting apps are registered in foreign jurisdictions and are not recognized by the Indian government.However, there are still social media and online adverts for these programs. The websites for the individual apps display a WhatsApp number and a registration link for players and gamblers on the landing page. A senior Enforcement Directorate official probing the matter revealed, “These apps work like casinos but the only difference is the legal validation. Casinos are regulated, while these apps are completely illegal and they do not have any book of accounts.”Another officer disclosed, “The WhatsApp link leads the person interested in playing or betting to the Paytm or G Pay options. Once they pay, the money goes to the accounts of the panel members who control the app or website interface. After deducting a percentage as commission, the panel members send the money to the Hawala accounts or shell companies. Then, through a process, the money is laundered to offshore accounts. One Hawala operator handles around 200-300 clients.”The agency additionally uncovered some evidence while looking into the specifics that related the Reddy Anna app with some key politicians and exposed crucial connections with Hyderabad. He mentioned, “We have found some sensitive details, which cannot be divulged at this point. We will file a detailed chargesheet this month.” The Mahadev betting application was created by four people including key accused Saurabh Chandrakar and Ravi Uppal from Madhya Pradesh and it gradually replaced at least 10 similar illicit betting apps that were being used all over the country. Lotus 365 and ReddyAnna are a couple of the applications that were once part of the Mahadev betting fold.As many as 34 Bollywood celebrities including actors, singers, dancers etc. have come under the Enforcement Directorate ED scanner in connection with the scam. Raftaar, Sonu Sood, Hardy Sandhu, Sonakshi Sinha, Malaika Arora and Amit Trivedi some of the names. The agency also summoned actor Ranbir Kapoor in relation to the case after several Bollywood personalities attended and performed at the wedding ceremony of Saurabh Chandrakar.

73,13-Oct-23,"As Hamas calls for ‘global Jihad’ after Israel declared war against it, Jewish students suffer hate and violence around the world","In the United Kingdom, four Jewish schools have been closed in North London to protect Jewish children from possible retaliatory attacks amidst the ongoing war between Israel and PalestineEver since Palestinian Islamic terrorist group Hamas launched an unprecedented attack on Israel and in turn Israel declared war against Hamas, Jewish students in various countries have been at the receiving end of hate and violence.In the United Kingdom, four Jewish schools have been closed in North London to protect Jewish children from possible retaliatory attacks amidst the ongoing war between Israel and Palestine. On Thursday evening, Torah Vodaas Primary School in Edgware, Ateres Beis Yaakov Primary School in Colindale, and Menorah High School in Neasden informed parents that they would be closed until Monday.Over the last four days, CST, a UK Jewish charity, reported a 324% rise in instances of antisemitism. According to CST, this includes six attacks, 14 direct threats, three acts of vandalism, and 66 incidents of abusive behaviour. Overall around 89 antisemitic incidents have come to light. We have received 89 reports of antisemitism in the last 4 days.Read more on our blog at https://t.co/8YcCjYuLpW pic.twitter.com/s18Y0fWjB8“A Jewish person walking to synagogue in London on Sunday morning got called “dirty Jew” by a stranger, who said “no wonder you’re all getting raped”. A Jewish person was on Oxford Street in London and the occupant of a passing van shouted “you f**king Jew I will kill you whole”. Graffiti reading “From the River to the Sea Palestine will be Free” was daubed on the former home of a Rabbi in Nottingham. A group of children in a school cornered a Jewish pupil, said they were “Jewphobic” and blamed him for the killings of Palestinians,” CST reported.A Jewish man told Sky News that his children’s school had asked him to change their uniform “so they are not signalling in any way they are Jewish.”“And in 2023 for my kids to go to school and it will not be okay for them to wear the uniform, a kippah (Jewish skullcap), star of David on their blazers, to have to hide their identity in 2023, it’s very scary,” he continued.Every day, at least three police officers stood outside their children’s school, according to their mother.Rabbi Chaim Pinter, the principal of Yesodey Hatorah, said that while additional measures including extra patrolling and providing counselling have been taken, students are avoiding public transport to save themselves from an attack from those hostile towards the Jews.Taking to X, renowned author J.K. Rowling shared a newspaper cutting which mentioned that the Jewish students have been advised to cover their traditional skullcaps with baseball caps as she wrote, “We said ‘never again.’ The UK was a safe haven.

An online watchdog has received almost 2,000 reports of antisemitic speech.The French Education Minister Gabriel Attal who recently visited a Jewish school near Paris said that Jewish students had faced “problems” in their schools, including a student in the wider Paris region who had been attacked by fellow students who ripped his t-shirt.”On Monday (9th October), a pro-Palestinian rally was held in Sydney where the Palestinian supporters raised “f&k the Jews” and “f*&k Israel”, “F*&k Albanese”, and “Allah Hu Akbar” slogans. The Hamas supporters also raised “Gas the Jews” slogans in a vile reference to the holocaust wherein at least six million Jews were brutally mass murdered by Hitler in Nazi Germany and the neighbouring countries it occupied in Europe. The mob hurled black Al-Qaeda flags as they chanted these hateful slogans. This sparked huge outrage in the country and on social media, which prompted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to condemn the hatred spread against the Jewish community. Later, three people were arrested for the hateful sloganeering against Jews.UNCUT VERSION – SHOCKING ""Gas the Jews' on the steps of the Sydney Opera House pic.twitter.com/kLv9QMex65Australian radio presenter Ben Fordham reported on Thursday (12th October) that anti-Israel material was being handed out at Australian universities with the staff working there also joining them, which has raised concerns among Jewish students studying there.Meanwhile, the organisers of a pro-Palestinian march in Sydney this weekend alleged that the NSW Police is considering using “draconian” powers however, it will not prevent them from having a peaceful gathering.Acting Commissioner David Hudson previously stated that NSW Police was considering using “extraordinary” powers to search and identify protesters ahead of the demonstration. He went on to say that if the “extraordinary” powers are granted, police will be able to search protestors without reasonable cause and demand identification, and failing to present essential documents will be considered an offence.Hudson added that a decision on whether there is sufficient grounds to authorise the powers outlined in the Law Enforcement Act will be taken by Saturday.Jewish students in various prominent universities in the United States have been targeted by Palestine and Hamas supporters. On Wednesday, a 24-year-old Israeli student at Columbia University was assaulted by a 19-year-old girl outside the varsity’s Butler Library. The victim suffered minor injuries, including a hand laceration. He attends Columbia University’s School of General Studies.According to the Columbia Daily Spectator, the university’s student newspaper, the victim claimed he tried to stop a 19-year-old girl from taking down leaflets with the names and photographs of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas terrorists. The victim man got into a furious argument with the woman on the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict. The altercation escalated, and the accused hit the 24-year-old guy with a wooden stick.A pro-Palestine rally was held at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) where a large crowd had congregated where protesting students were raising “Free Palestine” and “Intifada, Intifada” – a call to murder Israelis and Jews slogans.This is @UCLA where students are screaming ""intifada, intifada” – a call to murder Israelis and Jews.

The police in the state are looking into threats made against a number of synagogues. A Nazi Hakencruez was spray-painted on the side of a truck in St. Louis, Missouri, apparently mocking the Jews. The incident is reportedly being investigated by police as an act of antisemitic vandalism.An unforeseen attack on Israel by Hamas dubbed ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Storm’ that combined gunmen violating security barriers with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza was carried out at dawn on 7th October during the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah, killing at least 1,300 people, including children and the elderly, and injuring over 2000 others.In one of the worst attacks in history, the terrorists also assaulted women and abducted hundreds. In response, Israel launched ‘Operation Iron Swords’ and used Article 40 for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973, effectively declaring war.Apart from striking Hamas targets, Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza, as well as preventing supplies from entering the landlocked coastal strip. It is worth noting that Hamas has declared Friday, 13th October, as the day for global Jihad and has incited antisemitic sentiments around the world. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

74,13-Oct-23,"‘Hindus should be killed like Jews’: Islamist Arif Nashriyaat with over 90K Insta followers, echoes the Hamas calls for a ‘Global Jihad’","Arif Nashriyaat proclaimed his joy at the crimes committed by assailants affiliated with Hamas and posted, ""My Allah, you have given great peace to the hearts of us Muslims. Grant success to the Muslims of Palestine in the same way and also end the oppressors living in India soon. Amen.""The ongoing conflict between Palestine and Israel which escalated after the Hamas terrorists entered into the Jewish nation and mercilessly massacred citizens including the elderly, women and babies has found support from Islamists worldwide. Notably, the extremists in India are not far behind either. They are rejoicing in the bloodshed in Israel and desire to perpetuate similar atrocities against Hindus in India. They are repeatedly making genocidal calls to provoke their co-religionists into murdering Hindus.Arif Nashriyaat from Rajasthan who calls himself a ‘public figure’ has also joined the chorus and is baiting for the blood of the Hindus. He has around 92 thousand followers on Instagram and more than thirty-five thousand subscribers on YouTube and often indoctrinates his audience to pick up weapons for the cause of jihad. He has claimed that he is ‘dismantling the batil’ (falsehood according to Islam) in the biography of his account which also contains other Islamic messages. The influencer uses anecdotes from Islamic mythology to threaten and provoke violence against Hindus. In one of his recent videos, he alleged, “The Sanghis who slaughtered Iqbal, Nasir, Junaid, Waris, and Tabreez and murdered Muslims in buses, markets, mosques, forests, and prisons, I want to warn them to kill as many Muslims as they want like animals, but to keep in mind that when the slave of the Prophet Muhammad screams, it will move mountains.” It is important to note that the names he mentioned were of thieves and cow smugglers and the law is taking its own course in ensuring justice. Interestingly, he did not provide any evidence of his accusations because, in reality, Hindus are the ones who have lost their lives at the hands of Muslims whether as a result of Islamic terrorism, frequent attacks on Hindus and their religious processions or love jihad.He expressed his admiration for the gut-wrenching deaths of innocent civilians in Israel and boasted, “You RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) and Sanghi thugs are already terrified following what transpired in Israel. The world watched as Israel which you believed to be a major power with plenty of security and weapons was massacred like dogs by Palestinian Muslims.” Fanatics try to mask their innate bigotry with labels such as ‘Sanghi’ and ‘RSS’ and to deceive credulous people into believing that they aren’t anti-Hindu.He added, “The way you are tormenting Indian Muslims, the Sahaba (Companions of the Prophet of Islam) was tortured a lot more by the infidels in Mecca. However, they retaliated like the wrath of Allah and you are aware of the history of Umar and the sword of Ali.” Both Umar and Ali were caliphs of the Rashidun caliphate was the first caliphate to succeed the Islamic prophet. Interestingly, many fundamentalists around the world, including ISIS (Islamic State of Syria and Iraq) want to restore the caliphate where Muslims are the rulers and the infidels either convert, live in subjugation or lose their lives.A post shared by Arif Nashriyaat (@arif_nashriyaat_official)Arif Nashriyaat proclaimed his joy at the crimes committed by assailants affiliated with Hamas and posted, “My Allah, you have given great peace to the hearts of us Muslims. Grant success to the Muslims of Palestine in the same way and also end the oppressors living in India soon. Amen,” along with a picture bearing the Palestinian flag and Al-Aqsa Mosque and the words “Congratulations on Victory” exhibited on top. Arif Nashriyaat claimed that the Prophet Muhammad had two enemies, infidels who attacked him openly and religious hypocrites who did the same behind his back in another clip. “Indian Muslims also have two adversaries. One is the BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) which targets them publicly and the second is Congress which does it covertly. Those Indian Muslims who support these parties should understand that either they are with infidels or religious hypocrites. If the Muslims meet their end while siding with BJP or Congress it would be that of an infidel or a religious hypocrite.”“Where did Islam fall short that you want to join these political parties for your benefit? Did the prophet ever associate with infidels or religious hypocrites? What kind of Islam do you practice,” he asked while expressing his disgust for non-Muslims. Arif Nashriyaat is calling for Israel style attacks against Hindus. — https://t.co/SScvRyD5X0He is calling BJP and its supporters ""Kafirs"", and Congress and its supporters as ""Munafiqs"". — https://t.co/8ZXh9X32D5 pic.twitter.com/tGKhpECpuEArif Nashriyaat is a habitual offender who portrays Islam as the only true religion while presenting others as false. He spread fake news on the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act) and argued that Indian Muslims would be compelled to abide by constitutional rules rather than being permitted to conduct their life in accordance with the Quran. He threatened the Muslim women not to marry infidels because they would turn into one and face rape and murder. He denigrated non-Muslims as lowlives and firmly opposed idolatry as well as condemned celebrating any of their festivals. He even bragged about how his community would sacrifice their lives for Islam. He doesn’t want Muslim women to reveal their faces in public and wants them to remain inside the confines of their homes in order to execute ‘real jihad’. He is also of the opinion that music is ‘haram’ (forbidden) and anti-Islam. He admires the late Pakistani Islamic scholar and leader Dr. Israr Ahmad who gained notoriety for his radical ideology, support for Islamic supremacy and contempt for non-Muslims.There are hundreds of videos on his social media that provide a glimpse into his deeply radicalised and anti-Hindu mindset. He celebrates the murder of innocents and projects it as a form of resistance which is a text approach of jihad apologists and its enablers. He perpetually refers to Muslims as victims of oppression and justifies the terror executed by them as retribution. All of his uploads are received with resounding agreement and approval by his Muslim supporters.A major concern is that the Congress government which has a disgraceful record of giving a free run to jihadi elements has not taken any action against him despite all his hatred and Hinduphobia. It is a prime reason that such people feel emboldened under Congress regimes and spew venom against the majority community. Importantly, the Congress party recently passed a resolution in support of Palestine and criticised the terror inflicted by Hamas in a hogwash statement after the Modi government unequivocally stood with the Jewish nation and slammed Hamas. It is noteworthy that the growing hatred against Hindus which is a global minority and historically oppressed from Kashmir to Kerala continues to endure such vileness in the only country that it can call their home. The dismal condition of the community in its neighbouring countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh is a testament to the atrocities faced by them for generations and which they are experiencing to this day without any reprieve.

75,13-Oct-23,Delhi Police patrols area around Jama Masjid in the wake of Hamas’ call to global Ummah to mark Friday prayers as “day of Jihad”,"Delhi Police said it has urged members of the Muslim community to offer namaz at mosques in their areas of residence and not venture elsewhere to offer prayers.A late-night patrol was carried out in the walled city area, around the Jama Masjid on Thursday (12th October), Delhi Police informed, adding that the exercise was conducted in the wake of certain “inputs” they received amid the ongoing Israeli offensive in Gaza.The ongoing aerial assault by the Israeli forces is in retaliation to the multi-pronged terror attacks by Hamas.Delhi Police said it has urged members of the Muslim community to offer namaz at mosques in their areas of residence and not venture elsewhere to offer prayers.Video clips shared on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, showed a squad of bike-borne police personnel patrolling the Jama Masjid area, followed by another group of policemen on foot patrol.According to officials, the patrolling is part of an “institutionalised mechanism” conducted by Delhi Police from time to time.“We have appealed to people to offer namaz at mosques in their areas of residence and venture elsewhere or away from their neighbourhoods for the purpose,” an officer of Delhi Police said.“Security has been also beefed up at the Chabad House (Jewish prayer house) and other parts of Delhi as well. Security arrangements have been made wherever there are Jewish establishments,” the officer said.Patrolling is being conducted in order to maintain order and security around or through a specified area, Delhi Police informed.The patrolling comes amid Friday prayers when Muslims turn up in large numbers to visit the mosques and offer namaz. On 11th October, Hamas terrorist Khaled Meshaal, a former Hamas chief, called upon all Muslims across the world to join the fight against Israel on Friday.The terrorist designated Friday (13th October) as the “Day of Jihad” calling on Muslims to take to the streets and deliver a message of rage in a recorded message. “Deliver a message through the squares and the streets a message of anger that we are with Palestine,” the terrorist reportedly said.Israel’s Foreign Ministry and the National Security Council issued a joint statement on Thursday (12th October) urging all Israelis who are abroad to take extra care on Friday citing Hamas’ call to Muslims globally.At least 1,537 Palestinians have been killed and 6,612 others injured amid the ongoing Israeli onslaught on Hamas targets in Gaza, CNN reported citing the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.At least 36 people have died and more than 650 have been injured in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.United Nations Secretary-General spokesperson Stephane Dujarric said more than 338,000 Palestinians have been displaced due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas, CNN reported. He added that nearly 218,000 of those fleeing the Israeli air assault are sheltered currently in 92 schools run by the UN Relief and Works Agency.According to the UN, airstrikes have hit at least 88 educational facilities, including 18 UNRWA schools and 70 Palestinian Authority schools. Two of the UNRWA facilities were being used as emergency shelters for people who have been displaced, CNN reported.The UNRWA stated that 12 of its personnel have been killed since October 7.

76,13-Oct-23,"‘No place for terrorist organisations’: X removes hundreds of Hamas-affiliated accounts, community notes mislabelling official images as fake removed from posts","X CEO Linda Yaccarino said on Thursday that the social media platform has removed hundreds of accounts linked to Hamas and moderated thousands of posts since the terrorist organisations deadly attack on Israel. As the war between Israel and Palestine’s Hamas continues following the horrific terror attack on Israel on 7 October, a parallel battle is being fought on social media by the supporters of both sides. While Hamas terrorists have murdered over 1300 innocent Israeli citizens, by shooting them, stabbing and beheading them, and even burning them alive, Islamist supporters of Palestine are busy claiming that reports of such atrocities by Hamas are false. As a consequence, social media platform X, formerly Twitter, has removed hundreds of such pro-Hamas accounts.In a letter posted on X, CEO Linda Yaccarino said on Thursday that the social media platform has removed hundreds of accounts linked to Hamas and moderated thousands of posts since the terrorist organisations deadly attack on Israel. The X CEO said this in a letter addressed to European Commissioner Thierry Breton, a day after the EU official gave the platform a 24-hour deadline to address “illegal content & disinformation” regarding the Israel-Hamas war.Today @lindayaX responded to @ThierryBreton’s letter detailing our work in response to the terrorist attack on Israel. pic.twitter.com/yZtaOVGpHGThe EU direction was issued under the newly implemented EU’s Digital Services Act (DSA), as per which large online platforms like X and Meta’s Facebook are required to take more proactive measures to remove illegal content and address threats to public security and civic discourse.“X is committed to serving the public conversation, especially in critical moments like this and understands the importance of addressing any illegal content that may be disseminated through the platform. There is no place on X for terrorist organisations or violent extremists groups and we continue to remove such accounts in real time, including proactive groups,” Linda Yaccarino wrote in the letter.“Since the terrorist attack on Israel, we have taken action to remove or label tens of thousands of pieces of content, while Community Notes are visible on thousands of posts, generating millions of impressions,” added the letter.Yaccarino further expressed X’s willingness to engage further with the EU and its team, including holding a meeting to address any specific concerns. The CEO eagerly awaited additional details to which the platform could respond effectively. The X CEO said the platform has also responded to “more than 80” content takedown requests related to the conflict from authorities in the EU, adding the company has responded in a “diligent and objective” manner.Linda Yaccarino also talked about the ‘Community Notes’, feature of X, which allows users to fact check or add context to posts containing misleading or fake information. The CEO added that “more than 700 unique notes” have appeared next to posts linked to Hamas’ attack and the subsequent conflict.However, the same community notes feature is also being used to spread misinformation, and such community notes were removed after the notes labelled genuine information as fake. Notably, Islamists on social media have been trying to claim that Hamas didn’t kill babies, and images of infants killed by Hamas were posted on X yesterday, such Islamists added community notes claiming that the images are fake and AI generated.When actor Ben Shapiro posted photo of the charred body of a baby, such community notes were added, claiming it to be AI-generated. Some even posted screenshots of dubious ‘AI checker’ tools, which confirmed that the image was AI-generated.Ben had written in the tweet, “You wanted pictorial proof of dead Jewish babies? Here it is, you pathetic Jew-haters. Israel will minimize civilian casualties. But Israel will not allow the pieces of human shit who did this to live. Every ounce of blood spilled in Gaza is on Hamas.”But the fact is that the image is real, and it was posted by the official X account of the Prime Minister of Israel, along with other images including that of one showing an infant with bullet holes.After it emerged that the image is real and the community note was wrong, it was removed from the tweet. However, damage was already by this X tool which is supposed to fight fake news, as it was used to spread fake news, claiming a real image to be fake.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

78,13-Oct-23,"SDPI calls for district-level ‘solidarity’ meetings after Israeli retaliation to Hamas terror attacks, urges Indian govt to back Palestine","Intriguingly, the meeting is in line with the Hamas calls for a global jihad on 13th October, issuing a clarion call to Muslims and Islamists around the globe to hit the streets in protest and join their ""war"" against Israel.The Social Democratic Party of India, or SDPI as it is popularly known, has called for a ‘solidarity’ meeting in the wake of Israeli retaliation over the Hamas terror attacks that claimed the lives of over 1,300 Israelis. The organisation, known for its radical stances and Islamist apologia, has organised a meeting today i.e. Friday, 13th October, at 4 PM, at all district levels as a show of support for the cause of Palestine.Intriguingly, the meeting is in line with the Hamas calls for a global jihad on 13th October, issuing a clarion call to Muslims and Islamists around the globe to hit the streets in protest and join their “war” against Israel.The pamphlet designed by SDPI carefully paints the meeting in support of the “struggle of the Palestinians for their right to motherland”. What it doesn’t talk about is the circumstances that led to the Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip.SDPI, the political wing of the notorious and banned jihadi outfit PFI, glosses over the atrocities carried out by Hamas terrorists, including more than 7,000 rocket strikes in Israel and the ground invasion in the southern border areas that has killed over 1,300 Israelis, including babies, toddlers, and infants who were brutally killed, with many of them burnt alive.Earlier, the SDPI had even exhorted the Indian government to extend their support to the creation of a separate country for Palestinians. On Wednesday evening in Madurai, members of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) organised a demonstration, urging the Union government to advocate for the rights of Palestinians amid the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict.At Goripalayam, the SDPI members assembled and raised their voices in unified slogans. State secretary of SDPI, Najma Begum, delivered a speech to the assembled crowd, alongside the party’s district (north) president, Bilal Deen. The protesters strongly criticized Israel’s actions in the conflict, urging the Indian government to express support for the Palestinians. They emphasised the need for prompt intervention by the United Nations (UN) and other nations to facilitate peace restoration in the Middle East. A surprise attack deemed ‘Operation Al-Aqsa Storm’ by Hamas on Israel which combined gunmen breaching security barriers with a barrage of rockets fired from Gaza was launched at dawn on 7 October during the Jewish high holiday of Simchat Torah which resulted in the gruesome murder of at least 1,300 people including children and elderly while more than 2000 were wounded. The terrorists also raped women and abducted hundreds in one of the deadliest attacks in history. Israel then launched ‘Operation Iron Swords’ in retaliation and invoked Article 40 for the first time since the Yom Kippur War in 1973 and officially declared war.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

79,13-Oct-23,"UP: Adil, Najibul and Abu helped illegal Bangladeshi migrants to enter India, received 20 cr foreign funding to further their mission, arrested","The accused helped facilitate the illegal immigration of several Rohingyas and Bangladeshis and settled them in Uttar Pradesh for which thet received foreign funding to the tune of Rs 20 crore.On Thursday, October 12, the Uttar Pradesh ATS busted a human trafficking racket and arrested three Bangladeshi natives for helping illegal migrants from Bangladesh get forged Indian identity documents and illegally settle in India. The trio arrested from Deoband, Saharanpur were identified as Najibul Sheikh and Abu Hurayara, both residents of 24 Parganas, West Bengal, while the third accused was identified as Adil Mohammed Ashrafi alias Adil-ur-Rehman, a resident of Mirpur, Bangladesh.The accused, as per reports, were running a full-fledged human trafficking syndicate and had helped facilitate the illegal immigration of several Rohingyas and Bangladeshis and settled them in Uttar Pradesh. They had received foreign funding to the tune of Rs 20 crore to further their mission.The UP ATS recovered Rs 1.5 crores from the bank accounts of the accused. Besides, the police also recovered three mobile phones, forged Indian passport passports, PAN cards, Aadhaar cards and Bangladeshi sim cards from their possession.The police sent them to jail after booking them under multiple charges of fraud, cheating, impersonation and violations of the Passports Act. They were also charged with encouraging anti-national activities by providing them funds illegally by violating the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). ATS revealed that members of this human trafficking syndicate used to bring Bangladeshi citizens across the border to India and settle them here. The trio used to make fake Indian citizenship-related documents for this purpose. They had received Rs 20 crore as aid in the last three years to carry out their mission.ATS ADG Mohit Aggarwal said that the Varanasi unit of ATS had received information in this regard. ATS learned that syndicate member Adil Mohammad Ashrafi alias Adil ur Rehman is planning to go from West Bengal to Delhi or Saharanpur. After this, the team took action and caught him in Varanasi. A fake Aadhaar card and passport were recovered from him.During interrogation, Adil said that he is a resident of Bangladesh and has been living in UP for a long time. He added that he had got these documents with the help of Sheikh Najibul Haq and Abu Huraira Ghazi, residents of West Bengal. He said that both of them are currently living in Saharanpur of UP. Based on this information, ATS nabbed both of them from Saharanpur. All three confessed to their crime during interrogation. Both of the Bangladeshi nationals detained in Saharanpur admitted to fabricating documents for Mohammad Habibullah Masbah aka Najeeb, a Bangladeshi national. A few days ago, Habibullah was detained in Saharanpur.The probe also turned up evidence that some NGOs’ FCRA accounts received Rs 20 crore from abroad. The money was being sent under the guise of aiding madarsas and schools but was being utilized as a tool for human trafficking. This syndicate was using this money for illegal infiltration, making fake documents, providing asylum and anti-India activities.Notably, the Anti Terrorist Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh have launched a statewide crackdown on illegal Rohingya immigrants who have been living illegally in the state. In July this year, UP ATS detained as many as 74 Rohingya immigrants from several districts in the state. According to reports, 31 Rohingyas were detained from Mathura, 17 from Aligarh, 16 from Hapur, four each from Ghaziabad and Meerut and two from Saharanpur. The detained Rohingya immigrants include 55 men, 14 women and five children.Lucknow | Uttar Pradesh Anti-Terrorist Squad (ATS) arrested 74 Rohingya refugees in collaboration with UP police.

They had come from Bangladesh to India around seventeen years ago by obtaining fake Aadhaar cards, voter cards, and other Indian documents.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

80,13-Oct-23,Lessons from Hamas’ attack on Israel: The fake ‘Genocide of Muslims’ narrative in India will be used to justify Genocide of Hindus as ‘language of oppressed’,"Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door - which they do almost on a regular basisRight before dawn 5 days ago on a Saturday, Israel woke up to her worst nightmare. As the sirens blared and citizens of Israel looked for shelter, a couple of thousand Islamic terrorists from Hamas attacked the bewildered civilians from air, sea and land. As thousands of rockets and missiles rained down on Israel leaving in its wake destruction and a trail of dead bodies strewn on the streets, hundreds of terrorists on motorbikes, on foot and followed by tractors breached the fence separating Israel from Gaza. Simultaneously, terrorists also attached the beaches of Israel riding on motorbikes, overwhelming the unsuspecting Israeli soldiers. As the embers and smoke engulfed Israel, some of the Islamic terrorists descended on paragliders. After descending on Israel, the terrorists went city to city, village to village and kibbutz to kibbutz hunting down women, children and men alike. The visuals from the assault could perhaps be classified as traumatising, but worlds fall short when the Jihadi barbarity is laid threadbare, captured in images of charred bodies, burnt babies, raped and dishonoured women, and bloodied and murdered men. Several Jews were taken hostage by the terrorists as they cried and screamed for help, amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, they were beaten, spat on, dishonoured and kidnapped – carried at the back of their trucks to Gaza. The wound of seeing babies bloodied and murdered is one that Israel and the Jewish community would perhaps never be able to heal from. From babies who slept peacefully in their cribs to partygoers dancing their worries away, where 260 of them were slaughtered, the Muslim terrorists spared none. Amidst the scent of death and blood, the wails of tragic loss, the cries for help and the screams of rage, Israel rose as one. Several Israelis travelled back from wherever they were in the world to seek justice – to seek retribution. Old, young, men and women got called into duty – to defend the civilisational home of the Jews and to ensure those who had the blood of children and women on their hands paid a price for their barbarism. Israel then began to pound Gaza with rockers and missiles, flattening whatever stood in its path. On the 13th of October, Israel asked 1.1 million Palestinians to move from the North to the South – the instruction included for UN officials and those hiding in their premises to relocate as well – signalling that Israel was ready for a ground assault. Israel has also shut down the water and electricity supply of Palestine. Israel pleaded with the world – don’t look away. Look at the biggest onslaught against Jews since the Holocaust. Look at what the Islamic terrorists have done. They have killed our babies. Raped our women. Beheaded our sons. They want us gone – annihilated – murdered – humiliated. Don’t. Look. Away – they pleaded. They pleaded because they knew that as a country that fights for its very survival everyday will not be cowered down and that retribution will be theirs. As expected, when Israel started responding to Palestine’s mass violence against Jews, the narrative was not too kind to them, despite the fact that most countries which often gloss over Islamist violence came out vehemently in support of Israel – USA for example. Almost immediately, the narrative shifted to the brewing humanitarian crisis in Palestine with Israel shutting off its water and electricity supply. In one video, the former Prime Minister of Israel screamed – What is wrong with you? We are fighting the Nazis. How can you expect us to give water and electricity to our enemies”. 'Are you seriously asking me about Palestinian civilians? What is wrong with you? We're fighting Nazis.'Former Israeli PM Naftali Bennett adds 'if Hamas use anyone as a human shield, it is their responsibility.'https://t.co/PAiZ4D1jU3📺 Sky 501 pic.twitter.com/19nBKjOYOQThe media, however, continued what it does best – whitewash the crimes of Muslims and blame the victims of violence of genocide when they choose to stand up and say – ‘Thus far and no further’. The essence of these articles was simple – Israel is committing a genocide of Palestinians by way of its retaliatory action after Jews were raped, murdered, beheaded or injured. They were careful – though. They were careful to also give a “context” to the Palestinian attack against Israel. In an article headlined, “Palestinian Americans, Dismayed by Violence, Say Historical Context Is Being Overlooked”, The New York Times essentially provided context to the mass murder of rape of Jews by Islamic terrorists. The article said, “In interviews with more than a dozen Palestinian Americans, many said they were saddened by the violence against civilians, both Israeli and Palestinian, and hoped for a peaceful resolution. But many said that the underlying causes of the conflict could be traced to the policies of Israel and the United States, and decades of Palestinians being denied freedom of movement and basic rights”. The subtle agenda-pushing is a work of art that must be fully appreciated. In the article, the New York Times essentially pushes the narrative that Palestinians are lovely people who are very very… very sad about the “loss of lives” in Israel. They are empathetic and don’t support terrorism of any form. However, they are also terribly sad that the USA and perhaps the rest of the world are not understanding the historical context of why these lovely, peaceful, delightful people from Palestine raped, beheaded and tortured Jews in Israel. In turn and as a result, while it was the Jews who got raped, beheaded and tortured, it was the Palestinians who were the real victims not only because Israel launched a counteroffensive against them but also because the barbaric, Islamophobic world was refusing to understand why the Palestinians were forced to murder babies, rape women, behead civilians and torture/murder the men. Further in the New York Times article, another Palestinian is quoted saying the following: “These statements are really dehumanizing us,” she said, “and telling us that our lives are not worth anything.” In the eyes of those officials, she added, “we are never the victim, we are always the aggressor.”This statement was made in response to US’ support to Israel and statements demanding action against Hamas for their misadventure. But do you see what happened here? While the entire article asserted that the Muslims were the victims whether they were killing Israelis, facing retaliatory action or celebrating the murder of Jews, the Palestinian quoted here craftily plays victim to negate the incontrovertible fact that Islamic terrorists are indeed the aggressors. While these op-eds try to paint the Islamic terrorists as “Gandhis with guns”, they gloss over the fact that Gaza has been officially ruled by Hamas since 2017. They gloss over the fact that it is not just Hamas – Palestinians take to the streets to celebrate atrocities against Jews on a regular basis. They gloss over the fact that they may attempt to differentiate between Hamas and civilian Palestinians, but even the civilian Palestinians don’t differentiate between the state of Israel and average, civilian Jews because in the Hamas onslaught, celebrated by Palestinians and Muslims across the globe, those killed were average Jews, average Israelis – women, children, elderly. When we look at the incidents in Israel, this is what the apologists want the world to believe. Interestingly, there is an uncanny parallel to how the world arm twists Hindus every time they come under the attack of Islamists. The parallels of the narrative being crafted post-Hamas violence in Israel and the narrative which is crafted every single time Hindus come under the assault of Islamists have several parallels and lessons that Hindus can draw. While Hamas burnt alive Jewish victims in Israel, Dilbar Negi’s hands and legs were chopped off and he was burnt alive by Islamists in India just 3 years ago. The narrative has been eerily constant regardless of established facts – whether we discuss the partition horrors against Hindus or the current aggressions against Hindus. In this regard, it would bode well to remember the case of Mahashay Rajpal, who published Rangeela Rasool and was ultimately assassinated for it. We mostly hear that Mahashay Rajpal was assassinated for publishing a satirical work on Prophet Muhammad called Rangeela Rasool, but we seldom hear why he chose to publish the book. In 1923, Muslims published two particularly offensive books to Hindus. “Krishna teri geeta jalani padegi” used derogatory and vulgar language against Shri Krishna and other Hindu deities and “Uniseevi sadi ka maharshi” which contained derogatory remarks on Arya Samaj founder Swami Dayanand Saraswati (incidentally written by an Ahmadi).In response to this provocation by Islamists, Pandit Chamupati Lal, a close friend of Mahashay Rajpal, wrote a short biography of the Islamic Prophet, Mohammed. “Rangeela Rasool” was a short pamphlet which satirised the life of the Prophet of Islam. Pandit Chamupati made Mahashay Rajpal promise that he would never reveal the name of the author – he knew the consequences of it. Anonymously published under the name “doodh ka doodh aur panee ka panee”, the book enraged Muslims. Staying true to the values of one-way brotherhood, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi wrote in his pamphlet “Young India”, condemning Rangeela Rasool. While Gandhi ignored the provocation by Muslims, by the end of June 1924, the colonial government banned the book. The Muslim community, partly emboldened by MK Gandhi’s endorsement of their hurt sentiments and whitewashing of the provocation against Hindus, filed multiple cases against the book under 153A. In May 1927, Mahashay Rajpal, who published the book, was acquitted of all charges with the court observing that commentary based on facts on historical figures, including the prophet of Islam, cannot be said to promote enmity between groups. As soon as the verdict was delivered, Muslim mobs went into a frenzy. They rioted and demanded the head of Mahashay Rajpal. They were chants about how the murder of Rajpal was acceptable because, under Sharia, the punishment for blasphemy is death.On April 6th, 1929 a 19-year-old carpenter named Ilm ud din stabbed Mahashay Rajpal on his chest eight times while he was seated in the outer verandah of his shop. Though he was offered to give up the name of the author, Pandit Chamupati Lal, during the court proceedings, he refused and did not yield. He paid the price for it. He paid the price for publishing that book despite the court acquitting him and the Muslims getting a special law to protect their fragile feelings. Before Mahashay Rajpal was murdered brutally, the Muslims got their way and got 295A passed by the British, which aimed to protect their ever-outraged feelings. In this case too, it was the Islamists who mounted the initial onslaught by publishing books insulting Hindus. It was the Hindus who published one book in return. The response to that was the Muslims going on a rampage, rioting, committing violence and beheading Mahashay Rajpal. Through it all, it was the Hindus who were condemned by MK Gandhi while the Muslims, who indulged in violence, became the eternal victims getting a law to protect their feelings. Any conversation around this subject, till date, conveniently glosses over the Muslims publishing the two books first and their rampant violence later – what is remembered is that Hindus published a book that hurt Muslims and that Hindus are the community that must be blamed for the murder of Mahashay Rajpal because the Muslim hurt was justified. Not too long after India was torn apart by those who were convinced that the Muslim community could be placated. Before the Rangeela Rasool controversy, Hindus saw the Khilafat movement, and the support it got from Congress and Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and after that, Hindus saw the rise of a Muslim leader like Mohammad Ali Jinnah, leading India’s partition.16th August 1946 was the day when the call to massacre Hindus of Bengal was given by Muslim League founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah. Bengal, the only province in India under Muslim League rule at that time, was apparently chosen by the Muslim League leadership as the suitable place to unleash terror on Hindus in the name of “Direct Action”.In 1946, the massacre of Hindus in Bengal was rather intricately planned. Jinnah is recalled having said that he would either have India divided or India burnt and that he had given up on Constitutional methods to demand the creation of Pakistan. Jinnah had chosen the 16th of August as Direction Action Day because it was the 18th day of Ramzan, the day when the Battle of Badr was fought and won – a war fought by Prophet Muhammad himself, against the Kaffirs, and is considered to be won by Allah’s divine intervention by Muslims. The battle led to the violent occupation of Mecca. On the 16th of August, Calcutta was littered with posters lionising Jinnah and reminding Muslims that they had to follow the footsteps of the Prophet. It is reported that Syed Muhammad Usman, mayor of Calcutta, had issued a widely circulated leaflet that said: Kafer! Toder dhongsher aar deri nei! Sarbik hotyakando ghotbei! (Infidels! Your end is not far away! You will be massacred!). The aim was to make Bengal ‘land of the pure’ and rid it of the Kaffirs (Hindus). The aim was to wage another Battle of Badr, in which the Muslims would conquer the heathens. What followed on the 16th right after the Jumma Namaz is Muslims going on a rampage, beheading Hindus, chopping their limbs off and raping Hindu women. Several women were taken as sex slaves by those who were fighting with the religious fervour of the Battle of Badr. In the Kesoram Cotton Mills at Lichubagan in the Muslim-dominated Metiabruz area, Muslim mobs entered and beheaded over 600 labourers. The Hindus, neutered and asked by Gandhi to die with a smile on their face hardly fought back. There was a mass exodus from Bengal that marked millions fleeing because the massacre seemed too brutal to fight against.When Gopal Patha rose to defend the Hindus, it was MK Gandhi who asked him to lay down his weapons. The retaliatory, self-defence action by the Hindus were deemed the original onslaught and the openly religious violence against the Hindus were pushed under the rug to ensure that the Muslims continued to be the universal and eternal victims. Despite the historical atrocities committed by Muslims against Hindus, today, the Media goes no overdrive trying to push the narrative that there is an impending genocide against Muslims that the world is waiting to witness in India. Reams are written on how Hindus harbour animosity against the Muslims, depriving them of their legitimate rights, lynching them, killing them and humiliating them – building up to a genocide – much like that committed supposedly by Israel against Palestine. History and the current onslaught have been systematically whitewashed by historians, scholars, politicians and the corporate media – to an extent that the world has failed to see the realities of the Hindu population. Let us take the Nuh violence recently for example. Thousands of Muslims had descended on Hindus travelling to an area where the dominant demography was of Muslims. they were travelling there to simply worship Lord Shiva on an auspicious day for Hindus. They were pelted with stones, their cars burnt, held hostage inside the temples where the hostages included women and children and attacked with bullets, acid pouches and petrol bombs. Through it all, the narrative was that somehow, it was the Hindus who had provoked the violence because a) they dared to take out a religious procession in an area where Muslims predominantly live after ghettoizing the area and driving Hindus away and b) because of a rumour that a Hindu activist that the Muslims don’t like might be present at the procession – a lie which was spread by the Islamists themselves. Here is how Le Monde wrote about the Nuh violence. First, they turned one-way violence by the Islamists into “violence between Hindus and Muslims” simply because after the one-way violence, the Hindus had decided to defend themselves. Then, they blamed Hindu organisations for “genocide” and “terror” because they dared to speak about the violence and asserted that they would not accept attacks against Hindus. See a pattern with what is happening in Israel? The Islamists unleash violence. Their violence is justified as the language of the oppressed. When Jews decide to defend themselves and retaliate, they are called the aggressors and the terrorists who unleashed violence continue to be the victims, with the real victims being blamed for unleashing hate and genocide simply because they chose to defend themselves. After the brutal beheading of Kanhaiya Lal by two Muslims who then uploaded the beheading video on social media, holding the blood-dripping knife, global media blamed Hindus for asserting that their lives matter too. Here is what the TIME published. At the very onset, author Mansoor shifted the discourse from the beheading of Kanhaiya Lal to supposed ‘chilling calls for revenge’ against the ‘marginalised’ Muslim population. While trying to contextualise the murder of Kanhaiya Lal, Sanya Mansoor suggested that the poor Hindu tailor had drawn the wrath of the Islamists upon himself by supporting the ‘derogatory comments’ of ex-BJP spokesperson Nupur Sharma. Meanwhile, Mansoor also tried to shield the co-religionists of the killers and praise them for their token condemnations. “Muslim politicians and Islamic preachers swiftly condemned the killing,” she asserted while conveniently ignoring their collective silence over calls of ‘Sarr tan se juda chants all over India backed by the same people.Do you see the parallels? Here they are: When a Muslim gets lynched because he was a thief and primarily for such reasons, the media and the global world order are quick to call it an onslaught against Muslims by Hindus, however, when Hindus are lynched, beheaded, raped and murdered for explicitly religious reasons amidst the chants of Allahu Akbar, the Hindus have been historically blamed for the violence by the Muslims claiming that the Muslims are indulging in violence because the Hindus have somehow enraged them enough to go on a justified murderous rampage. To prove their point, they even invent crimes where they claim Muslims were beaten up amid Hindu religious slogans simply to justify crimes against Hindus amid chants of Allahu Akbar. They’re lies, screamed from the mountaintops versus our truths meekly repeated, with nobody to listen to us – that is the battle that Hindus have been fighting for millennia. History shows that progressively, a violent minority has strengthened the legislative, judicial and societal cover it gets to assert its religious supremacy aspirations. These aspirations are often negotiated after a violent, vehement and shameless assertion of street veto. The State and leaders who are meant to protect Bharat have bent a knee to the street veto and tried their damndest to assuage the perennially offended, the often violent and the perpetually demanding lot. Their constitutional special status keeps getting reaffirmed either by politicians or the judiciary in the hopes that the ever-so-offended lot will not take to the streets and indulge in rampant violence which the state is woefully incapable of controlling simply to prove just how downtrodden and oppressed they truly are. The intolerant minority has often held a sword to Hindus’ neck and forced us to concede that we have oppressed the sword-wielders.In this bargain, the global world order and the media has followed the pattern of demonising the victims of Islamic violence – the Hindus – and paint the aggressors – the Islamists – and the perpetual victims. In the case of Israel, we see large acceptance of their persecution and acknowledgement of her right to retaliate. Even then, the narrative demonising the Jews for fighting for their survival and civilisational identity is strong enough to spark violence and protests against the victims. Hindus have failed to do what the Jews have done spectacularly well – make the world aware of their own genocide, and their own persecution and ensure that normalisation of that hate is not only a punishable offence but one for which the society itself might ostracise you. We saw that play out after Hamas’ attack against Israel – those students from Harvard who blamed Israel for the terror attack against Jews by Islamic terrorists were forced to retract their statements because corporations started pulling away their job offers. The USA – which when it comes to India whitewashes the Islamic terrorists, was grieved and stood firmly behind Israel’s right to self-defence. The Muslim nations that wanted Israel wiped out mostly stood by mute because they knew the world stood by Israel and her right to self-preservation. As Israel flattens Palestine, there is recognition to some extent that the Jews, especially after suffering from the horrors of the Holocaust, will not stand by and get wiped out again. In India, however, partly because of the failure of Hindus themselves and the systematic whitewashing of history and news by scholars, political leaders and the corporate media, wails of persecution often go unnoticed. In fact, they don’t just go unnoticed, the narrative that we see media, Islamists and Leftists build against Israel today, is a constant against India with other players supporting Israel today joining in as well. Hindus need to be far more worried than Israel because the nations that stand with Israel today would not stand with Hindus when the barbarians come knocking at the door – which they do almost on a regular basis – because our own leaders are a part of the narrative demonising Hindus. Take Rahul Gandhi for example and how he today shields Islamists by calling IUML secular, endorsing calls to wipe out Sanatan Dharma, seeking foreign intervention to stop the Hindus and a caste census back home to divide the persecuted. The world will look away as Hindus get slaughtered and the narrative being crafted will blame Hindus for their own persecution and genocide, claiming that the violence unleashed by the Islamists is the “Language of the oppressed” – they are doing that today with Israel – but it would be far easier to do it with Hindus because, unlike Israel, we have traitors amongst ourselves and a world that has normalised persecution of Hindus after we failed to talk about our own plight for centuries. Today, far more than ever, Hindus need to learn from the Jews. Bharat needs to learn from Israel. If we don’t talk about our own persecution – nobody will. If we don’t protect our honour – nobody will. If we don’t stand up to our murderers being painted as the victims – nobody will. And if today we don’t realise the threats of Islamic terror and how it comes even for those who weep for the self-proclaimed marginalised Islamists today. The Hindus’ collective right to retain the cultural, religious and ethical integrity of the only land they have has to be held sacrosanct – legislatively, judicially and socially. This is, perhaps, the one lesson that Israel can teach us – that history is screaming out, waiting for Hindus to hear. Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

81,13-Oct-23,"‘Fauda’ actor Idan Amedi, who plays undercover agent Sagi Tzur, joins active combat duty to defend Israel against Hamas: Watch","In a video message shared by the official X account for the Fauda series, the actor is seen donning the war outfit and reassuring his fellow Israeli civilians. Idan Amedi, an Israeli singer-songwriter and actor best known for playing Sagi Tzur, a new undercover operative for the Israel Defense Force, in the immensely popular television action series ‘Fauda’, has joined Israel’s active combat force to serve his nation on the field against the Hama terrorist attack. This comes after Lior Raz, actor and producer of Netflix’s Israeli series ‘Fauda’ returned to front-line duty by joining a group of volunteers ‘Brothers in Arms’ to fight against the Islamist terrorist organisation Hamas.In a video message shared by the official X account for the ‘Fauda’ series, the actor is seen donning the war outfit and reassuring his fellow Israeli civilians. pic.twitter.com/J3xgTVfxlaIn the video, the ‘Fauda’ actor Idan Amedi is heard saying, “To the nation of Israel and all IDF soldiers both reservists and active duty soldiers, Idan Amedi here. As you can see, I am in a slightly different attire today. This is not a scene from Fauda. This is real life. Our Army was called up on Saturday morning, as the event in the South of Israel began and I wanted to tell you that alongside the horrifying and vicious attacks, wherein our friends and loved ones were murdered, our morale remains high. We fully comprehend why we are here, we are here to protect our children, our families and our homes and I want to promise you that we will not surrender until we win. I also want to sincerely thank all citizens all this dear country who send us care packages around the clock. Millions of items are sent to us daily, as well as beautiful written letters to us and drawings from the children. Thank you very much, It gives us strength and I love you, and hope we will see quieter days soon. Prior to him, Israeli actor Lior Raz, who is also the producer of the television series ‘Fauda,’ in which he drew on experiences in the Israel Defence Forces (IDF), took to the front lines of Israel’s war against Hamas by joining a group of volunteers ‘Brothers in Arms’.From the southern Israeli town of Sderot, the actor, who is a former Israeli special forces unit soldier, shared a video on social media that showed him accompanied by the president of the Israel Democracy Institute Yohanan Plesner, and journalist Avi Yissascharov.Notably, apart from Lior Raz and Idan Amedi other ‘Fauda’ stars namely Tomer Capone, Yaakov Zada Daniel, Tzachi Halevi have also returned to front-line duty.‘Fauda’ actor Guy Shalom told The Hollywood Reporter that the period piece Netflix series, set in the 1970s during the Yom Kippur War, is now mirroring the reality of present-day Israel. ‘Fauda,’ which launched in 2015, follows an undercover anti-terrorist unit in the West Bank. A fifth season was announced in September 2023.“I played a soldier guarding an Israeli outpost who suffers a surprise Egyptian attack during the Yom Kippur War. Who would have thought that 50 years later, Guy, the civilian, would feel just like my character, Yaron, the soldier?” Shalom said. “On Saturday morning I was awakened by sirens, and along with the sound came Hamas fighters.”The Hamas terrorists launched an unprovoked terrorist attack on Israel on October 7. They struck simultaneously from the air, sea, and on land, taking the Israelis by surprise. The death toll in the Hamas terror attack in Israel, which includes mostly innocent civilians including women and children, has crossed 1300, as per the latest reports, while over 3,300 are injured. Several gut-wrenching videos of the brutal massacre of innocent Israeli civilians have flooded the internet since the time the Hamas terrorists engaged in the bloodbath.In retaliation, Israel also launched a counterattack on the Gaza Strip and struck hundreds of Hamas sites. Israel has according to reports mobilised 3,00,000 troops. This is the largest mobilisation since the 1973 Yom Kippur War when Israel called up 400,000 reservists.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

In an advance warning of the same, IDF has warned civilians living in northern Gaza to evacuate to the southern part of the strip in just 24 hours.IDF issued a public notice on its X (Twitter) handle, calling for the evacuation of all civilians from Gaza City to the south of Wadi Gaza. It said that the civilians should evacuated for their own safety and protection. IDF added that Gaza city residents will be able to return only after it is allowed. The IDF also warned civilians against approaching the security fence along the Gaza-Israel border.Notably, Wadi Gaza is a small stream that divides Gaza into two parts and flows in the Meditation Sea.IDF announcement sent to civilians of Gaza City:The IDF calls for the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City from their homes southwards for their own safety and protection and move to the area south of the Wadi Gaza, as shown on the map. The Hamas terrorist organization…IDF said that Hamas terrorists are hiding in tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings with civilians, adding that it will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians.The public announcement by IDF said,The IDF calls for the evacuation of all civilians of Gaza City from their homes southwards for their own safety and protection and move to the area south of the Wadi Gaza, as shown on the map.The Hamas terrorist organization waged a war against the State of Israel and Gaza City is an area where military operations take place. This evacuation is for your own safety.You will be able to return to Gaza City only when another announcement permitting it is made. Do not approach the area of the security fence with the State of Israel.Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent Gazan civilians.Civilians of Gaza City, evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields.In the following days, the IDF will continue to operate significantly in Gaza City and make extensive efforts to avoid harming civilians.The public announcement came after IDF delivered the same warning to UN in Gaza, asking all residents of Gaza City to evacuate within 24 hours and move south Wadi Gaza. As per reports, IDF notified the United Nations office in Gaza at midnight on Friday that the entire Palestinian population north of Wadi Gaza should relocate to southern Gaza within 24 hours, a UN spokesperson said. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement in New York that nearly 1.1 million Palestinians live in northern Gaza, including the Gaza city.Gaza’s population is around 2.3 million, which means around half the population have been asked to evacuate northern Gaza including Gaza City.IDF also asked UN staff and people staying UN shelters to relocate south. The UN spokesperson informed the media that the warning was delivered by UN liaison officers in IDF to team leaders of the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the UN’s Department of Safety and Security in GazaHowever, the UN has requested IDF to rescind the order, saying that it is impossible for over a million to move in such a short period. The spokesperson said, “The United Nations considers it impossible for such a movement to take place without devastating humanitarian consequences. The United Nations strongly appeals for any such order, if confirmed, to be rescinded avoiding what could transform what is already a tragedy into a calamitous situation.”But IDF has refused to rescind the evacuation notice, and took to its X (Twitter) handle to make a public announcement of the same. Slamming the UN over the issue, Israel’s ambassador to the U.N., Gilad Erdan, said: “The UN’s response to Israel’s early warning to the residents of Gaza is shameful.”Salama Marouf, head of the Hamas government media office, said the IDF’s relocation warning was an attempt by Israel “to broadcast and pass on fake propaganda, aiming to sow confusion among citizens and harm our internal cohesion.” He urged residents to not leave their houses. Marouf said, “We urge our citizens not to engage in these attempts”.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

83,13-Oct-23,"‘Make Israel stop hitting Hamas in Gaza, Islam and Judaism do not support killing innocents’: Chief of Ajmer Dargah asks UN, Modi govt","""Being a Muslim I stand with the legitimate rights of Palestinian people but not with those who take guns into their hands and kill innocent people. The community should intervene and maintain the peace on the ground immediately"", the spiritual head of Ajmer Dargah, Hazrat Dewan Syed Zainul Abedin said.  The spiritual head of Ajmer Dargah, Hazrat Dewan Syed Zainul Abedin, on Thursday urged the United Nations and the Union government to intervene and bring a halt to the ongoing Israeli military operations in Gaza after deadly terror attacks by the terrorist group Hamas killed over 1,300 and more than 3,300 injured.Expressing deep concern over the lives lost on both sides in the wake of the terror attacks and the subsequent Israeli retaliation, Abedin said the killings were unjustified and are not consistent with the preachings of Islam and Judaism.The spiritual head of Ajmer Dargah was quoted as saying in a statement, “I appeal to the UN and Indian government to immediately intervene and bring hostilities to a halt in Israel and Palestine. The loss of lives of innocent people is unjustified and highly condemnable. It is against the teachings of both Islam and Judaism.”“I appeal with folded hands to both sides to stop this bloodshed for the sake of their respective religion and humanity. Every religion must detest violence in any form. Loss of innocent lives is strictly forbidden in Islam. This war must stop to safeguard innocent lives,” he added in the statement.“This is not an era of war. Peaceful dialogue is the only way out. It’s not about who won or lost. It’s about respecting each other’s rights and boundaries in order to safeguard HUMANITY FROM PERISHING. While as Muslims, we pray for safeguarding Muslim lives, we must also remember, Muslim or not, human life is very dear to Allah and scores of killings won’t grant us Allah’s favour,” he stated further.While coming out in support of the “legitimate rights of the Palestinian people”, he said, “Being a Muslim I stand with the legitimate rights of Palestinian people but not with those who take guns into their hands and kill innocent people. The community should intervene and maintain the peace on the ground immediately.”Meanwhile, as Israel’s counter-offensive against Hamas entered its seventh day, the Israeli Air Force said its fighter jets targeted Hamas operatives and destroyed military posts of the terror outfit.At least 1,537 Palestinians have, so far, been killed and another 6,612 injured in the retaliatory air strikes by the Israeli forces, CNN reported citing the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza.At least 36 people have died and more than 650 injured in the aerial assault in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

The US State Department has announced evacuation plans to help Americans leave Israel amid the raging war with Hamas. The US government will arrange charter flights starting Friday (13th October) to assist U.S. citizens and their immediate family members who cannot book commercial transit and seek a safe means of departing Israel.“From these locations, individuals will be able to make their own onward travel arrangements to the destination of their choice,” the statement read. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said while details on the flights are still being worked out, US citizens will be flown out from Israel “to sites in Europe” starting Friday.However, there’s a catch. Interestingly, those Americans seeking assistance to leave Israel will have to fill out a “crisis intake form” and reportedly “sign an agreement to repay the US government prior to departure, ” which US law requires. The “crisis intake form” for US citizens in Israel, accessed by OpIndia, provides four options under the Request Service section. When you select the third option which is for seeking assistance to leave, a new section “Additional Assistance” opens up. Under this section, the aid that has been provided is that of a loan from the US government to buy a commercial ticket.Americans will also have to make their own arrangements for accommodation in whichever country they arrive.

Departure assistance is provided via a loan from the US government which requires travellers to sign a promissory note (an agreement to repay) prior to departure.”The Meturgeman shared an updated email from the CACMS stating that if Americans choose to take the departure assistance, transportation will be by air to Athens or Frankfurt, or sea from Haifa to Cyprus. “You will not be able to choose your destination – we will assign you to the next available flight or ship,” the email reads.UPDATE: STATE DEPARTMENT PROVIDES AMERICANS STUCK IN ISRAEL WITH (LITTLE) MORE DETAIL, REITERATES THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY AND ARE AGAIN ON THEIR OWN ONCE THEY GET DUMPED IN CYPRUS, GREECE, OR GERMANY. https://t.co/Trs1EOylYa pic.twitter.com/JBopXJ9QfvAccording to abc news, commercial airlines like Delta Airlines, United Airlines, and American Airlines are in touch with the State Department to help set up flights for evacuation.On Wednesday (11th October), the State Department updated its advisory for travel for Israel and the West Bank to a level 3, “reconsider travel”. due to “terrorism and civil unrest” and it currently has a “do not travel” advisory for Gaza. The death toll of Americans killed in the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October has risen to 27.

85,13-Oct-23,"France, Germany prohibit pro-Palestine protests as hatred against Jewish citizens intensifies in Europe owing to Hamas’ call for Jihad","Chancellor Olaf Scholz informed parliament that anyone who supports Hamas, uses its insignia, or burns Israeli flags will be prosecuted, and that authorities will ""bring anyone who does such things to justice.""On Thursday (13th October), the Interior Minister of France Gérald Darmanin announced a ban on the pro-Palestininan protests in the country amidst the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Minister Darmanin has ordered the local authorities to enforce a ban on all pro-Palestinian demonstrations to maintain law and order.Meanwhile, French President Emanuel Macron has urged the people of France to stay united and not to add “national fractures to international fractures.”“This event is an earthquake for Israel, the Middle East and beyond. It is this shield of unity that will protect us from drifting away and from all hatred. Let us not bring ideological adventures to France by imitation or by projection. Let us not add national fractures to international fractures,″ Macron said.Restons unis.Ne cédons rien face à toute forme de haine. pic.twitter.com/2jyEck9BTtHistorically, fighting in the Middle East has heightened tensions in France, which is reported to have the world’s third-biggest Jewish population behind Israel and the United States, as well as the largest Muslim population in Western Europe.During the televised address, President Macron stated that 13 French citizens had been killed in Israel during the ongoing conflict, with 17 persons still missing, many of whom are suspected of being taken captive by Hamas. Meanwhile, the Paris prosecutor’s office launched an investigation into the killings and suspected kidnappings.Since Hamas attacked Israel on 7th October, the French government has reported 24 arrests for more than 100 antisemitic crimes in France, including verbal abuse, people captured with knives near Jewish schools and synagogues, and a drone fitted with a camera discovered over a Jewish cultural centre. An online watchdog has received almost 2,000 reports of antisemitic speech.Notwithstanding the ban, there was a sizable crowd of pro-Palestinian protestors in Paris on Thursday. Ten people were arrested and water cannons were used to disperse the 3,000-person gathering at Place de la République, where demonstrators raised anti-Israel slogans like “Israel murderer” and “Palestine will win”.On Thursday, 12th October, Germany declared a ban on pro-Hamas activities, as well as banned “Samidoun”, a pro-Hamas group that openly hailed the onslaught against Israel. Earlier, radicals affiliated with the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network gathered in the Berlin-Neukölln district and distributed sweets to celebrate Hamas’s attack on Israel. Notably, the Samidoun group has a history of organising gatherings glorifying Palestinian terrorism.Gestern fand in der Sonnenallee, in Berlin Neukölln eine angemeldete Kundgebung zur Unterstützung des Widerstands in Palästina statt.

Nor is it acceptable to drive through Jewish neighbourhoods, or single out Jewish members of the public, to aggressively chant or wave pro-Palestinian symbols at. Where harassment is identified, I would encourage the police to take swift and appropriate enforcement action,” the letter stated.London Police, however, rejected the Home Secretary’s proposed ban on displaying Palestinian flags. Deputy Commissioner Dame Lynne Owens has committed to safeguarding the Jewish community. However, Owens said that her officers would not take automatic action against Palestinian flag-waving demonstrators. Dame Lynne reiterated the Metropolitan Police’s position in an open letter to London’s Jewish communities.On Monday, three Palestine supporters were arrested in London during protests outside the Israel Embassy. On Wednesday, four were arrested outside Manchester Central Library in St. Peter’s Square during an anti-Israel protest.#GMP have arrested a young pro-palestinian protestor at St Peters Square #Manchester for wearing the #palestine flag. When asked, police stated it was for common law, breach of peace.

Most of the victims are civilians, as Hamas terrorists opened fire on civilian areas in Israel near the Gaza border. Hamas also abducted a large number of victims, holding them as hostages in Gaza. Bodies of over 1500 Hamas terrorists have been located in Israel and along the border, killed in retaliatory fire by Israeli forces.Hundreds of Hamas terrorists entered Israel through land, sea and even using paragliders, after overwhelming the Iron Dome missile defence system of Israel by firing over 5000 rockets in just 20 minutes. Israel has launched a massive attack on Gaza Strip following the terror attack and has struck hundreds of Hamas sites.

87,13-Oct-23,USA: Students start petition to remove Yale professor Zareena Grewal who had justified Hamas terrorist attack on Israel,"More than 28,000 people have signed the petition calling for Grewal's immediate removal. Her account is now protected limiting the viewership on the same.Yale University professor Zareena Grewal is facing backlash for tweeting in support of Palestine and calling Israel a “murderous, genocidal settler state”. In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Grewal wrote, “My heart is in my throat. Prayers for Palestinians. Israel is a murderous, genocidal settler state and Palestinians have every right to resist through armed struggle, solidarity.” She published the post on the very day the Hamas launched over 5,000 rockets at Israel and unleashed a brutal terrorist attack on civilians, killing over 1300 people and taking hundreds of hostages.Zareena Grewal has since been facing calls to be ousted from her position at Yale where she works as an associate professor of American studies, ethnicity, race, migration, and religious studies. Her biography on the Yale University website describes her as a historical anthropologist and a documentary filmmaker.She describes herself as a “radical Muslim” on her X profile. According to the New York Post, Grewal followed up her post with a series of tweets that “appeared to applaud” the brutality of Hamas. At least 1,300 people were killed including women, babies, and the elderly. Many have also been abducted and taken hostage.In one such tweet, the Yale professor wrote, “It’s been such an extraordinary day!” In a reply to journalist Rachel Sabhi’s tweet that read “Civilians are civilians are civilians, doesn’t matter where”, Grewal wrote, “Settlers are not civilians. This is not hard”.She also wrote in another post that “no government on earth is as genocidal as this settler colonial state”, referring to Israel.Now, a petition has been initiated on Change.org titled “Remove Zareena Grewal from the Yale Faculty for Promoting LIES and VIOLENCE”. The petition has been launched by Yale student Netanel Crispe.Crispe wrote, “She has unequivocally proven that she has no right being in her current role or in the field of education if she considers war crimes against civilians to be acts of resistance.”More than 28,000 people have signed the petition calling for Grewal’s immediate removal. Her account is now protected limiting the viewership on the same.Meanwhile, the University seems to be unwilling to take any action. A spokesperson for the University defended Grewal’s right to free speech saying, “Yale is committed to freedom of expression, and the comments posted on Professor Grewal’s personal accounts represent her own views,” the spokesperson, Karen Peart, told the student newspaper Yale Daily News.Meanwhile, president of Yale University Peter Salovey has condemned the terrorist attack on Israel.The development comes as some student groups at Harvard University faced widespread backlash for supporting and justifying the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October. After their letter blaming Israel was highlighted and several CEOs made it clear that they wouldn’t be hiring the terror sympathizers, the students started to backtrack, some apologizing and some pleading that they did not sign the letter knowingly.

About 13 soldiers were airlifted to the scene to counter the threat of Hamas.In the headcam video, it could be seen that the ‘Flotilla 13 Elite Unit’ personnel firde multiple rounds and captured the Islamist terrorists. “Shayetet, Shayetet, stay in the bunker, we’re coming,” one of the officers was heard saying.In the meanwhile, the death toll in the Hamas terror attack in Israel has crossed 1300, as per latest reports, while over 3,300 are injured. Most of the victims are civilians, as Hamas terrorists opened fire on civilian areas in Israel near the Gaza border. Hamas also abducted a large number of victims, holding them as hostages in Gaza. Bodies of over 1500 Hamas terrorists have been located in Israel and along the border, killed in retaliatory fire by Israeli forces.Hundreds of Hamas terrorists entered Israel through land, sea and even using paragliders, after overwhelming the Iron Dome missile defence system of Israel by firing over 5000 rockets in just 20 minutes. Israel has launched a massive attack on Gaza Strip following the terror attack, and has struck hundreds of Hamas sites. Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza and has prevented entry of supplies to the landlocked coastal strip.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

90,13-Oct-23,"‘Hamas is ISIS, Hamas is inhuman’: Israel govt shares horrifying photos of murdered Jewish babies from Kibbutz Kfar Aza massacre","As Thursday marks the sixth day of Israel Hamas conflict, Israel Defence Force (IDF) spokesperson Lieutenant Col. Jonathan Conricus confirmed earlier today reports that the Hamas had beheaded babies in the Israeli kibbutz of Kfar Aza. The spokesperson said it was hard to believe that Hamas could perform such a barbaric act, ANI reported.Describing Hamas as “monsters,” Israel has released horrifying pictures of babies killed by the terrorist group Hamas amid the ongoing war. The photos were reportedly shown by Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken during his visit to Tel Aviv, as per ANI.Notably, Blinken arrived at Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv earlier today amid the ongoing war initiated by the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, ANI reported.The official social media account of the Prime Minister of Israel shared the images and the post also said that Netanyahu showed the photos to Blinken.The Prime Minister of Israel posted on X, “Here are some of the photos Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu showed to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.”“Warning: These are horrifying photos of babies murdered and burned by the Hamas monsters. Hamas is inhuman. Hamas is ISIS,” the post cautioned. The pictures showed mutilated bodies of babies, some of them completely burnt and covered in blood.The international community condemned the violence after Israel-based i24 News reported in one of the blood-curdling details from the Hamas attack on Israel that at least 40 babies were killed by the terror group.Notably, the initial reports of 40 babies murdered were questioned by many. Many pro-Hamas handles and even news reports had tried to call it a false claim, saying it never happened. IDF had shared photos and videos of burned bodies, bloodied cribs and car seats, and desecrated homes. However, they had refrained so far from sharing photos of the corpses of babies. As Thursday marks the sixth day of Israel Hamas conflict, Israel Defence Force (IDF) spokesperson Lieutenant Col. Jonathan Conricus confirmed earlier today reports that the Hamas had beheaded babies in the Israeli kibbutz of Kfar Aza. The spokesperson said it was hard to believe that Hamas could perform such a barbaric act, ANI reported.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that Hamas should be crushed and that the group should be treated the same way as the Islamic State, or Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS).Highlighting the brutal acts committed by Hamas, PM Netanyahu said, “Hamas has shown itself to be an enemy of civilisation. The massacring of young people at an outdoor music festival, the butchering of entire families, the murder of parents in front of their children and the murder of children in front of their parents, the burning of people alive, the beheadings, the kidnappings of a young boy.”He said further, “Not only kidnap, molest the kidnapped and the sickening display of celebrating these horrors, the celebration and glorification of evil – President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this “sheer evil.”In his daily update video on Israel-Hamas attacks, Lt. Col. Conricus said, “The scenes are out of a zombie movie,” stating that it’s a war zone, he said, “There were babies that have been beheaded…it was hard to believe that even Hamas could perform such barbaric act.”He further highlighted the atrocities done to the civilians of Israel, including children.“There were bodies scattered everywhere, mutilated, women and children that were handcuffed and shot, executed, houses torched and burned, and people who were either burnt inside or suffocated,” Conricus said.The Israeli Air Force has been striking a lot of targets in various neighbourhoods in Gaza, he said.“We are prioritizing striking commanders, and senior officials in Hamas… whenever we have intelligence that indicates the whereabouts of the senior Hamas officials or military commanders, we strike in that location, IDF spokesperson emphasized.Additionally, noting the current situation of Gaza, he said that the place where Hamas has the infrastructure, whether it is financial, construction, or commander control, intelligence, research, and development…whatever it is, “if it belongs to Hamas, we are striking it and that’s what going on in Gaza strip today.”Furthermore, he said, “We are deployed in significant numbers, strength, and capabilities on the southern part of the border and we are very vigilant to any attempt by Hezbollah.”Israel has launched a counter-offensive against Hamas in response to the latter’s attack on October 7 that left 1,300 Israelis dead and is aiming to eliminate the terror group completely.The death toll in Israel since the Hamas attack has jumped to 1,300 and some 3300 have been injured, including 28 in critical condition and 350 in serious condition, according to The Times of Israel.The fate of an estimated 150 people abducted and taken to the Gaza Strip during the attack by Hamas is still unclear, the report said.It is notable here that the fight in Kibbutz Kfar Aza was going on till Tuesday morning, with IDF soldiers still trying to locate and kill Hamas invaders. The houses in the locality were being searched one by one as the IDF tried to save survivors and neutralize terrorists, while many units still battled Hamas terrorists. This is why the clearance and shifting of the bodies of civilian victims took several days. Kibbutz Kfar Aza is close to the Gaza border and used to be a peaceful community. Most homes there have reinforced safe rooms to protect them from Hamas terrorists, and concrete shelters to shield them from Hamas rockets. However, on 7th October, many families never got the chance to save themselves as Hamas terrorists physically barged into their homes and started killing. Some people who managed to get inside safe rooms have survived, but many have not. Several senior citizens have been killed while watering their plants, or sitting in their gardens. Babies have been killed in cribs. In some houses, entire families have been killed with Molotov cocktails, the IDF soldiers revealed to BBC news.

91,12-Oct-23,Kerala: Banned Jamaat-E-Islami to organise event to mark ‘solidarity’ with Hamas terrorists who have massacred more than 1300 innocent Israelis,"Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) was banned on February 28, 2019, by the Government of India following the terror attack in Pulwama as it was suspected of funding the terror organisation Hizbul Mujahideen.The radical Islamic organisation Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) is set to host an event to show ‘solidarity’ with the Hamas terrorists who massacred hundreds of innocent civilians in Israel. The event named ‘Palestine Solidarity Convention’ is scheduled to be held in Muslim-majority Malappuram District in Kerala on October 13. The poster of the event reads in Malayalam, “Zionist Adhinivesha Bheekarathakkethire” meaning “Against Zionist Occupying Terrorism”. Shocking exposure from Kerala Again..!!!A meeting is going to be organised by Jamaat-e-Islamic Hind on 13th Oct in Malappuram Dist, Kerala in support of Hamas terrorism & Palastine and it is said to be attended by the ambassador of Palastine to India.How can an ambassador… pic.twitter.com/4IgXg3Qk2VThe Islamist organisation has reportedly extended invitations to the Ambassador of Palestine to India, Adnan Abu Alhaija, and the Islamic University of Gaza Vice Chancellor, Dr Kamlain Shaa’ath. The Jamaat-e-Islami state committee member Dr. Nahas Mala confirmed the Palestinian envoy will address the convention virtually. However, it seems unlikely that Dr Shaa’ath, the vice chancellor of Gaza University, will attend the function amid the ongoing crisis between Israel and Palestine.The event is being organised to demonstrate support and unity with Palestine and Hamas, the Islamist organisation whose unprovoked attack on Israel has until now claimed the lives of more than 1200 innocent Israeli citizens.It may be recalled that the Islamist organisation Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) had recently grabbed the headlines for its role in instigating the hijab protests in Karnataka. The hijab controversy took a dangerous turn in Karnataka, leading to violence in many parts of the state. It is also imperative to mention here that a Kerala-based journalist had revealed how the Islamist organisation Jamaat-e-Islami has been receiving funds from Saudi Arabian universities to ‘Islamise’ India. Jamaat-e-Islami Hind (JIH) was banned on February 28, 2019, by the Government of India following the terror attack in Pulwama as it was suspected of funding the terror organisation Hizbul Mujahideen.Prior to this, on October 10, the Students Islamic Organisation (SIO), the student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, organised a gathering known as “Hamas Square” in Malappuram.Along with organizing solidarity gatherings around Kerala, Jamaat-e-Islami has urged people to participate in ‘special prayers’ to show their unwavering support for Palestine.Since Israel declared war following the Hamas terrorist attacks and ground invasion, the majority of the Islamists and other representatives of the Muslim community in India have also started supporting the global Ummah.Four days after students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) took out a protest march in support of Hamas terrorists, the All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has reportedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “siding with oppressors instead of with the oppressed” after PM Modi’s statement condemning the terror attack.In a statement released by AIMPLB President Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani on October 10, the body held Israel responsible for the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October which made Israel retaliate.Maulana Rahmani also justified the act of terror by Hamas which killed at least 1,200 people. “To call this reaction terrorism is to strengthen the oppressors, and is injustice to the victims,” the AIMPLB statement reads.Likewise, the chief of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has been backing Palestine and Hamas during the conflict. On 11th October, Asaduddin Owaisi shared a photo of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote, “Hands of GAZA, Falasteen Zindabad. Violence Murdabaad (done mainly by Israel or any Group/organisation). Masjid e Aqsa Aabad Rahe.”The AIMIM leader held Israel responsible for the attack by Hamas on Israel. The AIMIM leader has been resharing posts on X showing only Palestinian casualties while ignoring the murder of Israeli children.However, notably, PM Modi has categorically condemned the attack on Israel as a “terrorist act”. At least 1,300 people have died in Israel in the terrorist attack by Hamas, while over 3000 are injured.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

92,12-Oct-23,Batla House encounter: Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma’s wife to move SC challenging Delhi HC order commuting death sentence of Ariz Khan,"Delhi High Court on Thursday commuted the death penalty awarded to Ariz Khan to life imprisonment in the Batla House Encounter case in which Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma was murdered.After the Delhi High Court on Thursday commuted the death penalty awarded to Ariz Khan to life imprisonment in the Batla House Encounter case in which Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma was murdered, his wife Maya Sharma said that she would move Supreme Court.“Our morale is low. The trial court had earlier proved that it is the ‘rarest of the rare’ case, now it is absolutely fine that the convict had the right to appeal to the High Court. When he moved to the HC, then the punishment of the death penalty was commuted to life imprisonment. Now tell me, if the person is the culprit, why was his punishment reduced”? Maya Sharma told ANI.“We will definitely move to the Supreme Court. It is needed”, she added.Earlier today, the Delhi High Court on Thursday commuted the death penalty awarded to Ariz Khan to life imprisonment in the Batla House Encounter case in which Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma was murdered.The Court refused to confirm the death penalty awarded by the Trial Court in a judgement passed in 2021.However, the bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Amit Sharma upheld the conviction against Ariz Khan passed by the Trial Court. The bench accordingly disposed of the reference for confirmation of the death sentence awarded to Ariz Khan.The sentence of the death penalty was given to Khan by Delhi’s trial court for the murder of Delhi Police Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma on August 18, 2023, the bench of the Delhi High Court kept the order reserved after hearing all sides.In March 2021, the trial court awarded Ariz Khan a death sentence in the matter. Another convict, Shahzad was awarded a life sentence.Later, both convicts challenged their conviction and sentence.Shahzad, however, died in jail during the pendency of the appeals, and the proceedings against him were abated.While arguing for the state, the additional public prosecutor (APP), Rajesh Mahajan, submitted that the convicts were present in the flat at the time of the Batla House encounter. He also submitted that it is a case of the murder of a police officer while discharging his lawful duty, and this crime shook the conscience of society.“It is the rarest of rare cases. Both Shahzad Ahmed and Ariz Khan deserved the death sentence. There is sufficient evidence and a statement of witness to this effect”, he noted.He also argued that there was no chance of reforming Ariz Khan.On the other hand, advocate MS Khan, counsel for Ariz Khan, argued that the conviction in this case was bad in law as the trial court did not appreciate the material facts of the case.He also argued that the appellant was neither present at the flat nor had he absconded.The counsel for the appellant, Ariz Khan also disputed the recovery of documents related to him. He said that if these documents were recovered from the flat, why did this fact not come to the knowledge of the investigation officer until 2014?Advocate Khan also referred to the report of the inspection of the site by 11 forensic experts, which stated that there were no bullet marks on the sides of police personnel standing in the flat. But there were bullet marks on the side of the accused standing. It shows that there was one-sided firing from the end of the police.He also argued that, as per the prosecution Ariz had escaped to Nepal. He got married there and was teaching at a school there. It shows that he has already been reformed. In these circumstances, his appeal should be allowed.A trial court had convicted and sentenced him to life imprisonment for the murder of Inspector Mohan Chand Sharma, who was leading the police team during the Batla House encounter. It was alleged that the terrorists opened fire on Delhi Police personnel.According to Delhi police, Shahzad and Ariz had escaped from the spot and were arrested later. Later, convict Ariz Khan was arrested, and a supplementary charge sheet was filed against him.After the trial, the court held him guilty and awarded him a death sentence.The team of special cell of Delhi Police had reached in the Batla House area on inputs to nab the Indian Mujahideen operatives who were involved in the serial blast of September 13, 2008, in Delhi.(This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

Naor Gilon said.On possible involvement of Islamic State in the Hamas attack on Israel, the Ambassador of Israel to India, Naor Gilon has said that as the terrorist group continues to kill innocent civilians mercilessly, this is exactly Daesh.In an exclusive interview with ANI, Gilon said, “Yeah, we are looking into it…We have evidence for that. It’s not only the mode of operation, as I said…decapitating, killing people in terrible ways, torturing whole families without any mercy, without any thinking. This is exactly Daesh.”“And we also found flags of Daesh with the equipment of the Hamas people who were under attackers. So there is an ISIS Daesh. We call it connection here…” he said.Notably, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi formed the Islamic State, also known as Daesh, with its origins in Iraq and Syria in 1999. It rose to prominence in 2014 when it seized sizable regions in eastern Syria and northwestern Iraq.Speaking further on how the Israel-Hamas war will be a game-changer for the Middle East, the envoy said that all the negative forces in the Middle East are trying to destabilise the region.“I think if people understand what happened here, this is a game changer to the Middle East. It’s not about Israel…it’s not only about Israel. Of course, we are the victims here. ISIS is involved, Iran is involved. All the negative forces in the Middle East that were trying to destabilize the Middle East are now part of the reasons. I believe that the motivations they had here, they saw that the Middle East is going in a good direction. Three years ago, after the Abraham Accords, gulf countries getting closer to Israel,” he said.He also talked at length on I2U2 which is a grouping of India, Israel, the United Arab Emirates, and the United States.“I2U2 is an economic forum coming out of its whole, cooperation started. India was very much involved. India is also involved in the idea of creating transportation and communication and connection between India and the Mediterranean through the Gulf countries, Saudi Arabia and Israel. So all of that, these people didn’t want it to happen and they didn’t want Israel and Saudi Arabia to get closer. How far will we go in understanding that a huge change to the Middle East? I think we will go very far because if not, it will harm all the moderate regimes in the Middle East,” the envoy told ANI.I2U2 is also referred to as the West Asian Quad aimed to encourage joint investments between the member states in six mutually identified areas – water, energy, transportation, space, health and Food security.Meanwhile, Naor Gilon, as he talked further, argued that terrorism is terrorism, and attempting to provide context aims to portray the victims as oppressors.Expressing his concerns, Gilon said, “I see it very bad for two reasons. First…I saw some people across the world trying to give it context. There is no context to killing 1,200 people. More than 1000 civilians. Decapitating, raping, and whatnot. There is no context to that. Because if you try to do that, but,…you try to justify terror. You are a supporter of terror if you do that”.He also pointed out that the approaches of Israel and India are similar with regard to terrorism.“Our approach, also of India and all peace-seeking countries is that terror is terror. It can’t be justified, don’t put the context, don’t blame me…you turn the victim into the one who committed the crime,” he added.Gilon also raised concerns that Hamas might try to present themselves as ‘victims’ and use civilians as ‘human shields’.“Now, what will happen next is Hamas crying we are the victims, and you will see human shields, and probably…people abducted from Israel as human shields also. This is going to be very complicated,” Gilon said.The death toll in Israel since the Hamas attack on October 7 has jumped to 1,300 and some 3300 have been injured, including 28 in critical condition and 350 in serious condition, The Times of Israel reported.The fate of an estimated 150 people abducted and taken to the Gaza Strip during the attack by Hamas is still unclear, the report said.Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said the military has so far notified families of 97 hostages who were being held by terrorists in the Gaza Strip, The Times of Israel reported. (This news report is published from a syndicated feed.

94,12-Oct-23,"London: Ex-Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone pleads guilty of tax fraud, receives suspended sentence of 17 months","Bernie Ecclestone was accused of failing to disclose more than £400 million (around 650 million US dollars at the time) in foreign assets to the government of the United Kingdom.Bernie Ecclestone, the former head of Formula One, admitted guilt to the charge of fraud and was given a 17-month suspended jail term. He was accused of failing to disclose more than £400 million (around 650 million US dollars at the time) in foreign assets to the government of the United Kingdom. He altered his plea at a case management hearing on 12 October at Southwark Crown Court after initially challenging the allegations at an earlier hearing in August. His trial was scheduled to begin in November.He consented to a legal settlement for 652.6 million pounds (803 million dollars) regarding money owed to the British tax authority over an 18-year period. He was sentenced to a 17-month prison term with a two-year suspension as well as ordered to pay £74,000 in prosecution fees. The court of Judge Justice Bryan recognised the ‘undeniable seriousness of his offence’ but noted that he had also taken into account the defendant’s age, his health and the potential effects of a prison sentence on his small kid. The judge instructed the 92-year-old to stand up when he handed down the punishment. When questioned if he comprehended the sentence, he responded, “I do.”The judge ruled, “Your offending is so serious that neither a fine nor a community order would be appropriate. It is rightly acknowledged that the custody threshold has been passed.” He mentioned the issues in the case for which the offender would be sentenced and noted, “Towards the end of the meeting you were asked if, since the conclusion of the previous investigation in 2008, and excluding the trusts referred to so far in the course of the meeting, whether you were linked as a settlor or beneficiary to any other trust in or outside of the United Kingdom.”He further continued, “You replied ‘no’. That was a lie. You were in fact linked to a trust structure known as the ‘Kinan Trust’ and another known as the ‘Nanki Trust’. I also bear in mind, as the prosecution has made clear before me, that the prosecution is very mindful, and has kept under careful review, the public interest in bringing and continuing these proceedings given your age and health.”The court observed, “The prosecution has borne in mind the report of the cardiologist Professor Knight and the evidence given by him to this court as to your health and the risks that would be presented by a trial.” In response to the civil settlement amount reached with HMRC, the judge stressed, “I accept that this settlement reflects a determination and demonstration of steps taken on your part to address your offending subject to this indictment and also reflects remorse on your part for your offending.”He was implored for a remark as he exited the court and he smiled and nodded but his response was garbled as he went into the rear of a white Range Rover. He entered the courtroom dressed in a grey three-piece suit and declared to the judge, “I plead guilty.” One of the most well-known figures in international motorsport, the billionaire oversaw Formula One from the late 1970s until January 2017. During that time, he tightened control over the commercial and sporting aspects of the company while growing Formula One into a valuable global media asset.America’s Liberty Media purchased it in 2017 from the previous private equity proprietor CVC. After he was ousted as Formula One’s supremo, Liberty set out to regain the interest of younger viewers. One of their efforts was the production of the popular Netflix documentary Drive to Survive which they did after his reign’s last months witnessed a decline in viewership.He was charged with fraud by false representation when it was claimed he neglected to disclose the existence of a Singaporean trust. According to the accusation, he deceptively told HMRC in July 2015 that he had only created one single trust on behalf of his children.The charge, per the prosecutor, Richard Wright KC was connected to a meeting between him and tax officials on 7 July 2015. He told the court that the businessman should have clarified that he was unable to answer when asked if he had any connections to further trusts “in or outside the UK” but instead chose to respond “no” considering that he was unaware of the reality of the situation.He conveyed, “The funds held there were very substantial and the annual losses and gains were tens and millions of United States dollars. Mr Ecclestone accepts that his answer ‘no’ was misleading.” He emphasised that he was “seeking to a draw a line under investigations into his tax affairs” and added that “He was fed up of paying huge bills for advice.” Christine Montgomery KC, his attorney notified the judge that his defendant “bitterly regrets the events that led to this criminal trial.” Bernie Ecclestone’s wife Fabiana, a vice-president of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), the organisation that governs motorsports and a member of the FIA International Motorsport Council has previously attended court with him. He has a little boy named Ace and three grown-up daughters named Deborah, Tamara and Petra.Simon York, the director of the tax authority’s fraud investigation service, announced the accusation in July and highlighted that it came after a “complex and global criminal investigation.” He pronounced in July, “HMRC is on the side of honest taxpayers and we will take tough action wherever we suspect tax fraud. Our message is clear, no one is beyond our reach.”His public comments in recent years praising Russian President Vladimir Putin and supporting him in response to the invasion of Ukraine, particularly last year when he proclaimed that he would “take a bullet” for the Russian leader have gained traction. Formula One dissociated itself from the statements and stressed that they did not reflect the organisation’s viewpoints. He also expressed regret and apologised later.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

95,12-Oct-23,"IIT-B professor equates vegetarians with “militants”, blames casteism for food choices of Hindus","IIT Bombay professor Suryakant Waghmare blamed upper caste Hindus for ""militant vegetarianism"" Professor of sociology at the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) Suryakant Waghmare has equated vegetarians with “militants” (terrorists) amid the controversy over separate tables for vegetarians at the institute.Written by a Sociology teacher at IIT Bombay: ‘Disgust against beef is display of hegemony of vegetarianism’Never before have I seen such disgusting justification of cow slaughter, which is not only inhuman but also has been a symbol of Hindu hate for centuries. As per this… pic.twitter.com/95smfYxUrMIn an opinion piece published in The Indian Express, Waghmare typically blamed the Hindu, more so the upper caste Hindu, for “militant vegetarianism” whose followers “seek to continually sustain the traditional ethics and aesthetics of segregation and hierarchy in food consumption”.He even blamed such vegetarians, who he has implied are upper-caste Hindus, for citing environmental concerns as the reason for being vegetarians.And yet, the IIT-B professor was careful enough to not offend vegans as he wrote, “Unlike veganism, which may emerge from compassion, the foundations of militant vegetarianism lie in varnashrama dharma and graded inequality”.Like every true Hindu-hating left-liberal, Waghmare did not fail to enlist “outcastes”, Christians, and Muslims as the victims of “militant vegetarians”. And naturally, the professor threw in the term “cow nationalism” to say that “the hegemony of vegetarianism over the last century has institutionalised disgust against beef eaters”.On 1st October, the mess councils along with the Wardens and Associate Wardens of three hostels of IIT-Bombay imposed a fine of ₹10000 on an unnamed student for creating chaos and flouting mess rules.The development came three days after the said student, along with 2-3 others, deliberately ate non-vegetarian food in a reserved vegetarian section of the mess on September 28, 2023.It must be mentioned that only 6 out of 129 tables in the dining area were reserved for vegetarian students while the remaining could be utilised by both vegetarian and non-vegetarian students.The decision was not taken by the administration of IIT-Bombay but by the students’ councils of Hostel 12, 13 and 14 along with elected representatives.In Hinduism (or Sanatana Dharma), vegetarianism is associated with faith. Moreover, consuming cow meat which is beef is considered a sin because the cow is considered an all-loving mother of humans, animals, and nature alike.Furthermore, Jainism also prohibits meat consumption from the point of view that no living being should be harmed, let alone murdered, and there must be peaceful co-existence among all beings.And yet, Islamists, leftists, liberals, and other Abrahamic religions like Christians too have not only been critical of Hindus for being vegetarians but have committed crimes to violate their faith.In July this year, former chairperson of Infosys Foundation, Sudha Murthy was subjected to ridicule after she revealed in an interview that she carries her own bag of food and cooking items when travelling abroad because she is a vegetarian.Casteist remarks were hurled at the author by Hindu-hating leftists on X, formerly Twitter.On 7th September, a Dalit girl was force-fed beef by two Muslim men named Shoaib and Nadeem and spiked cold drinks were forced down her throat. After intoxicating the victim, the accused gang-raped her and recorded the barbaric act on video. A third accused named, Shifat Ansari, a girl, was also named.In a case from the Fatehpur district of Uttar Pradesh, a Muslim man, Ahmed Sharif, disguised as a Hindu under the false name Ajay Singh, entrapped a Hindu woman and married her. The woman was pressured to convert and consume beef.In May, a Muslim man named Ismail Yusuf was arrested in Surat, Gujarat for selling samosas stuffed with beef.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

96,12-Oct-23,"Bihar: Madarsa teacher booked for raping a minor girl several times, Panchayat called to ‘settle’ the matter, money offered to withdraw case","According to the victim's mother, Tariq, Mumtaz, Anjar, Shamsher, Munna, Chhotkan and others were in attendance in the panchayat that gathered to shield the accused.In the Saharsa district of Bihar, a Madarsa teacher named Mohammad Imtiyaz alias Chunna was accused of raping a 13-year-old girl several times. The victim’s mother had lodged a complaint against the accused on 8th October. Accused Imtiyaz’s crime came to light after the minor victim got pregnant. While the accused has been arrested, the victim is undergoing treatment at a hospital after her child was aborted.A panchayat was called by some people belonging to the Muslim community to ‘settle’ the matter. The victim’s mother alleged that accused Mohammad Imtiyaz had threatened to kill the victim if she informed anyone about his crime. She claimed that after she filed a complaint against the accused and an FIR was registered at the Sadar Thana police station, a panchayat was called and the victim was offered Rs 10,000 to withdraw the case.According to the victim’s mother, Tariq, Mumtaz, Anjar, Shamsher, Munna, Chhotkan and others were in attendance in the panchayat that gathered to shield the accused. Tariq is stated to be the Ward Commissioner (Ward Councillor) among these persons involved in pressuring the victim’s family to ‘compromise’. Moreover, they suggested that the victim should take abortion medications. Notably, a POCSO Act case has been filed against the accused.In the complaint, the victim’s mother explained that she and her husband lived in Delhi. They had left the girl at her grandmother’s house so she could attend the madarsa and continue her education. However, Imtiyaz sexually abused her for months.The victim’s grandmother said, “Imtiaz from the madrasa was doing wrong things with my granddaughter. He would threaten her with violence if she ever spoke out, which is why she couldn’t tell anyone. She started experiencing abdominal pain and had a high fever, so she was prescribed medication. When she didn’t improve, we took her to a private hospital, where we found out that the madrasa Hafiz Mohammad Imtiyaz had been sexually abusing her. Doctors operated to remove the fetus to save the girl’s life.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds. In name of saving democracy, they get money from various sources.

Citing Syria’s state television, Reuters reported that Israel launched attacks on the main airports in the capital Damascus and the northern city of Aleppo on Thursday.As per Syrian local channel Sham FM, Syrian air defences were launched in response to both attacks. Citing local reports, Arab News said that the attacks were “simultaneous” and they “damaged landing strips in the two airports, putting them out of service.” The Israeli military has not made any comments on this.No one was injured in the attacks, state news agency SANA said, quoting an unnamed military source.Israel keeps hitting targets in Syria, including the Damascus and Aleppo airports, as Syria is used to route weapons to Hamas, Hezbollah and other Palestinian terror groups. Iran is known to have used Syria to send support to Hamas. It has been reported that Israel targeted the airports to disrupt Iranian supplies to Syria.  In the meanwhile, there are claims on social media that Israel struck the airports just before an Iranian flight carrying weapons was to land at Damascus.#BREAKING Israel conducts simultaneous air strikes on #Damascus & #Aleppo International Airports, blocking oncoming Iranian flights that contain smuggled weapons for Iran’s proxies on Israel’s borders.It has been claimed that an Airbus 340 flight from Tehran to Damascus was carrying Iranian Foreign Affairs Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, several commanders of the Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps and tons of anti-tank missiles for Hezbollah.

98,12-Oct-23,"Gujarat: Unidentified miscreants pelt stones at Shiva temple; uproot and throw saffron flag in the drain, investigation underway","The priest of the temple told OpIndia how such incidents occur every year when Navrati is around the corner and urged the authorities to investigate the matter thoroughly.
A Hindu temple has been vandalized in Umreth, the taluka seat of Gujarat’s Anand district, a few days before the auspicious annual 9-day long Hindu festival Navratri commences on October 15. The incident reportedly took place late at night on Wednesday, October 11, when some unidentified miscreants tore and threw the saffron flag installed in the temple and also tried to damage the Shivling placed in the temple’s sanctum sanctorum and the Nandi idol placed outside.The incident reportedly occurred at the Shree Siddhnath Mahadev temple which is situated on the banks of a lake near Odd Bazar, located in Anand’s Umreth. This is the same area where recently, a Muslim mob stormed the Chandramaulishwar Mahadev temple and nearby areas with swords and sticks after an argument broke out between Hindus and Muslims over the molestation of minor Hindu girls by Muslim youths.Meanwhile, in yesterday’s incident, some unidentified miscreants hurled stones at the Shree Siddhnath Mahadev temple and vandalised the saffron flag placed there. They also tried to damage the idols of Nandi and the Shivling, but they failed in their attempts, as the iron gates of the sanctum sanctorum in which the Shivling is placed were locked and the Nandi idol, though placed outside in the open, is made of stone hence it could not be damaged.The incident came to the fore when the following morning, on Thursday, October 12, the temple priest and a few worshippers arrived at the temple. They saw that the safforn flag placed on top of the temple was missing and there were stones and bricks thrown inside the temple premises. Upon searching, the devotees found the safforn flag thrown in a nearby drain, after which they informed the police.Some videos have been circulating on social media, in which stones and bricks are seen scattered around the temple.આણંદના ઉમરેઠમાં એક શિવમંદિર પર હુમલાની ઘટના સામે આવી– પ્રાચીન સિદ્ધનાથ મહાદેવ મંદિર પર મોટા મોટા પથ્થરો ફેંકાયા, નંદી મહારાજની મૂર્તિ ખંડિત– સ્થાનિકોનો દાવો, ભગવાનની મૂર્તિ ખંડિત કરવાનો પણ થયો પ્રયાસ– ભગવા ધ્વજને નાળામાં ફેંકી દેવાયો – પુજારીની ફરિયાદ બાદ પોલીસ અજ્ઞાત… pic.twitter.com/ExXqtc73JRSince the incident failed to grab mainstream media attention, OpIndia contacted local sources to delve into the details of the incident. We were told that a similar incident had occurred there a few years ago, due to which fencing was erected around the temple. We were also told that every night, until around 11 p.m., local Hindu youths keep sitting around the temple premises, which is why the miscreants chose to attack the temple around midnight.The local Hindus accused some local Muslim youths of being behind the incident. They alleged that four youths were involved in the vandalism, however, they could not be identified.OpIndia also spoke to the temple priest who confirmed that the safforn flag was placed in the temple only three or four days back. He added that the miscreants pulled down the saffron flag that was placed on the back gate of the temple and threw it in the drain. He also revealed how he saw stones and bricks scattered around the temple premises.He revealed that there is the dargah of Jorawar Pir Bawa just 200 meters away from the temple. Further, calling it a matter that needs to be investigated thoroughly, he lamented how such incidents occur every year when Navrati is around the corner. OpIndia spoke to PSI Ghanshyamsinh Pavara of Umreth Police Station who said that the police found stones and bricks lying outside the temple. While, in the viral video, one can clearly see small pieces of stone lying outside the sanctum sanctorum of the temple, which possibly got stuck to the mesh fence placed outside, the PSI said, “We feel that this is the work of drunken people as there is no stone pelting in the sanctum sanctorum or any attempt to damage the temple.” Nobody has been named as of yet. An investigation is being conducted.”On Sunday, June 6, around midnight, a Muslim mob with weapons stormed the roads of Umreth and held the entire area hostage. The incident took place two days after the molestation of 2 Hindu minors by Muslim youths in the area.According to reports, there was a dispute between the Hindu-Muslim community in Umreth, the taluka headquarters of Anand district, over the molestation of two Hindu minor girls, and around Sunday night, a Muslim mob stormed the area near the Chandramuleshwar Mahadev temple with swords and sticks, creating an atmosphere of fear in Umreth.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

There will be no situation in which Israeli children are murdered and we all go about our business.”He said that the Hamas terror attack was “the worst terror attack the world has ever seen.” He added, “Children bound together and murdered, people burned, barbaric deeds that the Jewish people has not suffered since 1945.”PM Benjamin Netanyahu also reiterated his resolve of action against Hamas, saying that “every Hamas member is a dead man.” The PM said in the press conference, “We saw the wild animals. We saw the barbarians that we are facing. We saw a cruel enemy. An enemy worse than ISIS. We saw boys and girls, bound, shot in the head. Men and women burned alive. Young women raped and slaughtered. Fighters decapitated… In one place, they set fire to tires around them, and burned them alive.”“We are fighting with full force, on every front; we have gone onto the attack,” said.The press conference was held after PM Netanyahu and National Unity Party head Benny Gantz announced that they were forming a “national emergency government.” The small war cabinet is composed of Netanyahu, Gantz and Defence Minister Gallant. Gantz and the prime minister said that they decided to put politics aside to unify efforts on behalf of the nation.Former IDF general National Unity MK Gadi Eisenkot along with Minister Ron Dermer will serve as observers in the war cabinet. Other than this, the Security Cabinet, which will work under the War Cabinet, will be expanded to include 5 members of the National Unity Party.In the meanwhile, the death toll in the Hamas terror attack in Israel has crossed 1300, as per latest reports, while over 3,300 are injured. Most of the victims are civilians, as Hamas terrorists opened fired on civilian areas in Israel near the Gaza border. Hamas also abducted a large number of victims are holding them as hostages in Gaza. Bodies of over 1500 Hamas terrorists have been located in Israel and along the border, killed in retaliatory fire by Israeli forces.Hundreds of Hamas terrorists entered Israel through land, sea and even using paragliders, after overwhelming the Iron Dome missile defence system of Israel by firing over 5000 rockets in just 20 minutes. Israel has launched a massive attack on Gaza Strip following the terror attack, and have struck hundreds of Hamas sites. Israel has also cut power and water supply to Gaza, and have prevented entry of supplies to the landlocked coastal strip.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

101,12-Oct-23,AIMPLB and Asaduddin Owaisi say Hamas terrorist attack on Israeli civilians is Israel’s fault,"PM Modi has categorically condemned the attack on Israel as a ""terrorist act"". At least 1,200 people died in Israel in the terrorist attack by Hamas.Four days after students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) took out a protest march in support of Hamas terrorists, other representatives of the Muslim community in India have also started supporting the global Ummah.The All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) has reportedly said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is “siding with oppressors instead of with the oppressed” after PM Modi’s statement condemning the terror attack.In a statement released by AIMPLB President Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahmani, the body held Israel responsible for the terrorist attack by Hamas on 7th October which made Israel retaliate.Maulana Rahmani also justified the act of terror by Hamas which killed at least 1,200 people. “To call this reaction terrorism is to strengthen the oppressors, and is injustice to the victims,” the AIMPLB statement reads.Meanwhile, the chief of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has been backing Palestine and Hamas during the conflict. On 11th October, Asaduddin Owaisi shared a photo of the Al Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem on X, formerly Twitter, and wrote, “Hands of GAZA, Falasteen Zindabad. Violence Murdabaad (done mainly by Israel or any Group/organisation). Masjid e Aqsa Aabad Rahe.”Hands of GAZA,Falasteen Zindabad.Violence Murdabaad (done mainly by Israel or any Group/organisation )Masjid e Aqsa Aabad Rahe pic.twitter.com/7RKgE1bqe9The AIMIM leader held Israel responsible for the attack by Hamas on Israel. The AIMIM leader has been resharing posts on X showing only Palestinian casualties while ignoring the murder of Israeli children.On 9th October, the AIMIM President had said that India historically stood with Palestine. The AIMPLB, too, said that India has always held the stand that Israel should listen to UN’s calls.Congress MP Shashi Tharoor too drew flak for refusing to call Hamas as a terrorist group while appearing on national television. Tharoor was called out by the former envoy of Israel to India Daniel Carmon.However, notably, PM Modi has categorically condemned the attack on Israel as a “terrorist act”. At least 1,200 people died in Israel in the terrorist attack by Hamas.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

102,12-Oct-23,Old news of Congress leader getting arrested and lashed in Saudi viral again: Here is how he got into trouble for holding Bharat Jodo poster in front of Kaaba,"In January, the youth Congress leader shared his picture where he, in a show of allegiance to the Gandhi scion, posed with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during the Haj pilgrimage. He was soon arrested and thrown in jail by the Saudi police.On Thursday, October 12, an 8-month-old picture of a youth Congress leader Raza Kadri holding a placard to support Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Joda Yatra in front of Kaaba in Mecca went viral on social media. The old viral picture resurfaced after the Congress leader, after spending 8 months in Saudi Arabia jail, returned to India last week.Several social media users shared the old picture of the Congress youth leader on X, formally Twitter, with assertions that he was jailed and received 99 lashes from the Saudi authorities as punishment for insulting the Kaaba.Congress leader Raja Kadri got a two-month sentence and received 99 lashes as punishment for insulting Kaba with a Congress poster.Requesting Congress atleast give him MLA ticket😂😂😂 pic.twitter.com/BZQNQA9wif⚡Congress Leader ""Raja Kadri"" displayed a poster of the ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during Haj pilgrimage.Later he was arrested and put behind bars by Saudi Authorities and got two-month sentence and 99 lashes as punishment. He just completed his imprisonment and released. pic.twitter.com/mWkAkc75w9In January this year, the youth Congress leader Raza Kadri, a resident of Niwari district near Jhansi in Madhya Pradesh, shared his picture where he, in a show of allegiance to the Gandhi scion, posed with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Bharat Jodo Yatra’ during the Haj pilgrimage. In the picture, the Congress leader stood with a poster of Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra in his hand against the backdrop of the Kaaba, the Islamic shrine located near the centre of the Great Mosque in Mecca and considered by Muslims everywhere to be the most sacred spot on Earth.Notably, displaying any type of flag or placard is unlawful action in Saudi Arabia including at Islamic holy sites. The Indian Consulate has time and again advised its citizens to comply with the rules. For obvious reasons, Kadri’s public display of loyalty towards his boss did not sit well with the Saudi authorities. Two days after the picture of Raza Kadri surfaced on social media, the Saudi police hunted him down at the hotel where he was staying along with other pilgrims of Madhya Pradesh; promptly arrested and put him behind bars, where he was subjected to an eight-month sentence and received 99 lashes as punishment.On October 4, 2023, the youth Congress leader returned to India after he was released from the Saudi jail. Now following his release and return to India, his old picture has resurfaced on social media.After returning, the youth Congress leader, in an interview with the Hindi daily Bhaskar, shared his harrowing experience in the Saudi jail. He revealed how he was kept in a dark and dingy room and not allowed to sleep for the first two months in jail. He was given only 2 pieces of bread to eat for lunch and dinner and was not allowed to speak to his family back in India.The Congress leader recounted how he was tricked by the Saudi police and arrested from his hotel at around 2 a.m. in the night on January 26, 2023. The police covered his face with a black mask handcuffed him and brought him to the police station. He was told that he had flouted Saudi Arabia’s rules which is why he was arrested.After arrest, he was thrown into the Dhahban Central Prison also known as Dhahban Prison, a maximum security prison facility located near Dahaban, Jeddah, in Saudi Arabia. For the next two months, he was kept in a dark room and interrogated every day. Further recounting the torture he went through the Congress leader said that the Saudi police used a lie detector machine to verify every answer he gave to them. Before going through the lie detector test he was fed some liquid which made him very drowsy, however, he was not allowed to sleep. The authorities used to throw water on him to keep him awake. He added that he was confined to that dark gloomy chamber in Dhahban Central Prison for six months. Neither did he see the sunlight nor the face of a single human being. After experiencing a mental breakdown, he was sent to a psychotherapist who incidentally was an Indian.The doctor advised the jail superintendent to transfer him to a normal jail. To his luck, the jailer took the advice and after two days he was transferred to a normal jail, where he recalled his condition was no better. Indian housed in that jail were discriminated against, Raza Kadri revealed, adding that they were provided insects and bug-infested blankets and beddings and served food in areas which were dirty.Finally, on October 2, the Congress leader was released from jail and he returned to India on October 4, 2023. Recounting the torture he was subjected to by Saudi Arabia authorities, the Congress leader said, “yahan aakar aisa laga ki jahannam aisa hi hota hoga” (once I came back I realised this is how hell must be like).The Bharat Jodo Yatra, Rahul Gandhi’s brainchild, began on September 7, 2022, in Kanyakumari and concluded on January 30, 2023, in Kashmir’s Srinagar. It began at a time when Congress was facing dissent, resignations, internal tussle, and so on. All in all, Rahul Gandhi’s Bharat Jodo Yatra was more of a vanity project launched in a desperate attempt to revive the grand old party and moreover relaunch the Gandhi scion.All the PR and marketing of the supposed foot march was all for nothing as it turned out that the Gandhi scion along with his team was rallying with 59 luxury containers equipped with beds, attached bathrooms, air-conditioners, couches, mini conference halls and what have you. The entire fiasco cost nearly Rs 300 crore.It had several controversies to its credit, details of which can be read here.Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.

103,12-Oct-23,"New Karnataka education policy: Yogendra Yadav, the protestor for hire, and Professor Japhet, who drafted anti-superstition bill specifically targeting Hindu rituals, part of committee","It is notable that the ""Duggal Sahab"" of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers' protest in which he took the avatar of a 'farmer leader' was a ""political stunt"" meant to oust BJP from power.On Wednesday (11th October), the Congress government in Karnataka constituted a committee of ‘experts’ to formulate the Karnataka State Education Policy which would replace the National Education Policy (NEP). The state government has issued a ‘Government Order’ (GO) forming a 15-member committee headed by Professor and former Delhi UGC Chairman Sukhdev Thorat, with a secondary group of eight subject experts/advisers rendering expert input. The committee will submit its report on February 28 next year.“The government is pleased to accord sanction to the State Education Policy Commission for the preparation of a draft Karnataka State Education Policy under the chairmanship of Professor Sukhdev Thorat, an eminent Educationist. Economist, Professor, Writer and Former Chairman of UGC New Delhi,” the GO stated.As per the government circular, the 15-member committee includes- Professor S Japhet, Founding Director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP), Sudhir Krishnaswamy, Vice Chancellor of National Law School of India University (NLSIU), Sharat AnanthaMurthy, Professor, School of Physics, University of Hyderabad, A Narayana, Professor at Azim Premji University’s School of Policy and Governance, among others.Meanwhile, Bhagyavana S Mudigoudra, Special Officer, Department of Higher Education, will be the commission’s Member Secretary, coordinating and maintaining the meeting’s proceedings.Today, the Karnataka Government announced the formation of a 15-member committee tasked with crafting a new education policy for the state. In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established to provide insights and guidance in this endeavour. pic.twitter.com/4Qkms8a342In addition to the committee, an advisory board has been established for expert advice. It is interesting to note that the eight-member expert group includes protestor for hire Yogendra Yadav alongside Professor Rahamath Tarikere, Retd Professor in Kannada, Kannada University, Hampi; Professor Janaki Nair, Historian and Retd, Professor at the Centre for Historical Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru University, Sonam Wangchuk, Engineer turned Education Reformer and Director of the Himalayan Institute of Alternatives, Ladakh (HIAL), Professor Valerian Rodrigues, and two others.It is notable that the “Duggal Sahab” of political activism, Yogendra Yadav had admitted last year that the farmers’ protest in which he took the avatar of a ‘farmer leader’ was a “political stunt” meant to oust BJP from power. Moreover, Yadav had also given a similar statement in a debate on NDTV on 10 March 2022 while discussing the UP Assembly Election results. He said the farmer’s movement led by Samyukt Kisan Morcha played a vital role in building the foundation for the opposition parties to defeat the BJP in UP, however, the opposition parties essentially the Samajwadi Party did not play well.Unsurprisingly, Yogendra Yadav also has links with the controversial financier and regime change specialist George Soros. It is notable that in February this year, George Soros openly expressed his disdain for Prime Minister Narendra Modi and accused him of crony capitalism saying that he has good relationships with businessman Gautam Adani. OpIndia has published detailed reports on George Soros’s Open Society Foundations (OSF) which has been backing anti-India elements operating inside India.It is worth noting that previous UGC chairman Sukhdev Thorat, who would lead the aforementioned committee, has been a vocal opponent of reservations for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS). Thorat stated his discontent with the ‘upper caste’ Hindus, primarily Brahmins, “dominating” India’s power structure in an interview with Islamist propaganda portal Maktoob Media. Additionally, he insinuated that caste-based reservations should be applied to the private sector in order to narrow the gap between the upper castes and the SC, ST, and OBCs in terms of indicators like life expectancy, child mortality, etc.It is worth recalling that Professor S Japhet, founding director of the UGC-sponsored Centre for the Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policy (CSSEEIP) was a prominent player in drafting the controversial Anti-Superstition Bill, in 2013. It is worth noting that the bill intended to outlaw ‘superstitious practices’ was a pet project of Karnataka CM P Siddaramaiah.The controversial bill aimed to ban practices like made snana which involved any person or persons roll over (uruli seve) on the leaves of leftover food by other persons in any public or religious places or similar practices saying that it violated human dignity. Performing fire walks during Jatras and religious festivals, Baibiga practice which involved piercing of the jaw from one side to another, Mata mantra, Gandra Dora practices for treating snake, scorpion or dog bites etc were deemed inhuman acts.“Creating panic in the minds of the public in general by way of invoking ghosts or mantras. Persuading, propagating or facilitating rituals that involve self-inflicted injuries such as hanging from a hook: inserted into the body (sidi) or pulling a chariot by hook inserted into the body,” the bill stated.While the bill included self-inflicting injuries to define Hindu rituals, the bill did not mention Muharram, an occasion of mourning for the Shia sect of Muslims who inflict injuries to their own bodies using chains and sharp objects in public places. Moreover, the bill mentioned ‘ghosts’ and practices performed on the pretext of expelling them from the person possessed including physical assault and forcing one to perform sexual acts, however, there was no mention of Satan, Shaitan and Jinn and weird practices involved in expelling them from a person ‘possessed’ by them.Back in 2013, Professor Japhet had said that through the bill an attempt has been made to “define the superstitious practices as those that cause grave physical, mental or sexual exploitation or offends human dignity”. It is amusing that Japhet failed to or deliberately did not ‘define’ comparable superstitious practices in other religions.Notably, after much outrage from the people and political parties, the bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature in 2017 when Congress leader Siddaramaiah was the chief minister of Karnataka.Two years before drafting the bill, Japhet wrote an extensive piece on the plight of Dalit Christians in 2011, in which he admitted that Christians from non-Dalit communities discriminate against Christians who convert from Dalit communities. Despite this, S Japhet did not include evangelism and conversion based on the promise of equality as a superstition.The formation of a committee to frame Karnataka state education policy comes after the Congress government had in August announced that its government will implement its own policy rejecting the Centre’s NEP. In May this year, Siddaramiah had said that he would not allow the education sector to be adulterated in the name of the new education policy.Siddaramaiah claimed that the Central Government’s national education agenda is ‘incompatible’ with the federal form of governance. “It has several anomalies that undermine the Constitution and democracy,” remarked the Chief Minister. “Uniform education system does not suit a nation like India which has diverse religions, languages and cultures”. While the chief minister asserted that the NEP will not ‘suit’ India since the country has diverse languages, the NEP directs to lay “emphasis on promoting multilingualism and Indian languages; The medium of instruction until at least Grade 5, but preferably till Grade 8 and beyond, will be the home language/mother tongue/local language/regional language.”Whether NDTV or 'The Wire', they never have to worry about funds.
